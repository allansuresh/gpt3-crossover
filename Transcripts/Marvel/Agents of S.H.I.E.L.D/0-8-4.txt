HQ: S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6, you have course confirmation. You are cleared direct to the Slingshot. Agent Coulson, everything all right up there? We heard you had a little dustup on the ground.
Phil Coulson: Yeah, we're all good. It's gonna be blue skies from here on out.
(Side of the plane blows up, alarms go on)
Jemma Simmons: Coulson! Hang on!
(Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. logo shows on the screen)
(Skye is packing her stuff from her van)
Skye: Hey, no joy rides, okay? That's my house.
Man: No worries.
(Man puts a device on the hood of the car)
Skye: Where do they think of this stuff?
(Coulson, Ward and May discussing around a table)
Grant Ward: Skye? Girl's not qualified to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.
Coulson: Agreed. That's why I've invited her on as a consultant. S.H.I.E.L.D. does it all the time. Technically, Stark's a consultant.
Ward: And technically, Skye's a member of the Rising Tide. She hacked our RSA implementation.
Coulson: Twice. From a laptop. Imagine what she'll do with our resources.
Ward: I am. That's exactly what I'm imagining during this frown. You brought me on for risk assessment. She's a risk. She doesn't think like us.
Coulson: Exactly.
(Fitz and Simmons meet Skye)
Simmons: Oh, Agent Coulson told us the news. What a wonderful surprise. Isn't it, Fitz?
Leo Fitz: Yeah.
Simmons: No, it's wonderful.
Fitz: Yeah, a surprise.
Simmons: You must be very excited.
Skye: Yep, first day of school.
Simmons: Okay, so just -- sorry. Yeah.
(Back to Coulson, Ward and May)
Melinda May: We have two kids on this bus who aren't cleared for combat. You're adding a third.
Ward: At least Fitz-Simmons are trained S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. But Skye? You said this was a select team. Assembled to work new cases, to protect people. I don't see how letting some hacker tag along -
Coulson: I'm looking for an objection I haven't already anticipated. I'm calling this. But your frown will be on record.
Ward: We've been called in to investigate an 0-8-4. We all know what that means.
Coulson: Yes, we do. It means we don't know what that means.
Fitz: Officially, it's an airborne mobile command station, but we call it the bus. We find it best to use shorthand when in the field. But everything has to be just so, you know, because of the danger.
Skye: Yeah, I've been up here before, but I didn't see much because of the bag that Agent Ward put over my head.
Simmons: Yes, so sorry about that. Water?
May: Wheels up in two. Lock it or lose it.
Skye: What's that mean?
Simmons: No backing out now. Let's find a bunk for our guest.
Fitz: Oh, oh, yeah, there's only one left, and it's right next to mine. So sorry, uh-
(Ward knocks on the bunk wall)
Skye: Hey. I know we didn't really-
(Ward interrupts Skye and gives her an info brochure of the plane)
Ward: Might want to read that. This isn't like other planes.
(Skye looks at the brochure, Ward leaves)
Skye: You could say that again.
(Coulson walks in)
Coulson: Say what again?
Skye: Sweet ride.
Coulson: I earned a little goodwill from Director Fury when I got hit right before the battle of New York.
Skye: You took a bullet?
Coulson: Ish. An Asgardian stabbed me through the heart with a Chitauri scepter. The effect was similar. Got a few weeks' R&R and this plane. Had it completely refurbished. Studs up -- spared no expense.
Skye: Yeah, Agent Ward told me they sent you to Tahiti.
Coulson: It's a magical place.
Skye: You mentioned that.
Coulson: Here. Use a coaster. I'd buckle up.
(Skye puts her water bottle on the coaster, she and Coulson sit down)
Skye: I don't even know where we're going.
Coulson: Peru. That's where the 0-8-4 was reported.
Skye: And an 0-8-4 is?
Coulson: An object of unknown origin. Kind of like you. Team goes in, determines if it's useful or if it poses a threat. Last one turned out to be pretty interesting.
Skye: And what was the last one?
Coulson: A hammer.
(The plane flies over a forest and May lands in Peru)
(Two S.H.I.E.L.D. cars arrive at the site of the 0-8-4, the agents get out of the cars)
Ward: Tire tracks 40 meters back. I'll check them against the site's trucks -- make sure we're alone.
May: Too much exposure here. I'm gonna find a place to park.
Fitz: I would love to see a capuchin in the wild. Maybe even a yellow-tailed woolly monkey. You know, um, Peru has 32 different species of monkeys.
Simmons: Yeah, and close to 200 species of snakes. The Shushupe has a fascinating ven-
(Fitz hits his luggage onto the side of a car)
Simmons: -venoms. It's neurotoxic, proteolytic, and hemolytic.
(Both chuckle)
Fitz: That's fascinating.
Simmons: Yeah.
(Simmons notices that Fitz is getting nervous)
Simmons: Oh. No, I'd be much more concerned with earthquakes, mala-
(Simmons slaps Fitz' back to kill an insect)
Fitz: Oh-
Simmons: There's no vaccine for dengue fever. Oh, look at this.
(Fitz and Simmons walk to a temple)
Skye: We should warn the people who live around here if the 0-8-4 is dangerous. They're already dealing with anti-mining rebels and the shining path guerillas. I could post something.
Coulson: Remember the panic when that anti-matter meteor splashed down just off the coast of Miami, nearly devoured the city?
Skye: No.
Coulson: Precisely. Because we kept it quiet and contained.
Skye: So, what am I doing?
Coulson: Well, if it gets out, I might need you to create some kind of diversion, put the public on the wrong scent.
Skye: So everything that I'm against.
Coulson: Yep.
(Coulson walks to the temple to meet a man)
Coulson: Good morning, Professor. I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. I understand you've made an interesting discovery.
Professor: I-I'm not sure how to explain it. This temple dates back at least 500 years. It's filled with pre-Incan artifacts. One of them is impossible and looks like it might be dangerous.
Coulson: Well, that's why we're here.
(They walk inside the temple)
Professor: Watch out.
(The 0-8-4 is a machine stuck in the wall of the temple)
Professor: Exactly as we found it.
Coulson: Who else knows about this?
Professor: Just the ministry. I believe they are the ones who contacted you.
Coulson: Sir, I need you and your team to evacuate the site until we determine the risk associated with this object.
(Drones start flying and scanning the area, including the Professor)
Simmons: Leave the man alone.
Coulson: Now. For your own safety.
Skye: There's nothing about this anywhere. It's amazing. I searched every data stream. What do you got here, guys?
(Skye tries to touch the 0-8-4)
Fitz: Whoa, car- uh, careful. I-I- no, wouldn't do that.
Simmons: The object's placement in fossiliferous rock formations suggests it's been here for at least 1,500 years. That pre-dates this temple by a millennium. Ah! Maybe it's alien.
Fitz: Yeah, but the shape and the craftsmanship? It's almost German.
(Ward walks to the temple to talk to May)
Ward: Tires match the prof's truck. Where's your sidearm?
May: If I need a gun, I'll take one.
Ward: Right. Forgot I was working with "the cavalry".
May: Don't ever call me that.
Ward: Apologies. I've heard the stories -- what went down in Bahrain, about you in action. You know, it was smart of Coulson to pull you out of retirement. It's nice to have a trusted friend who has your back.
(Ward attacks a solider, May joins in
(More soldiers arrive, Ward has one as a hostage)
Ward: Should have taken more guns.
(A woman walks in while the men shout in Spanish)
Ward: on the radio Sir?
Coulson: Go.
Ward: We have a situation.
Skye: Lots of rebels in this area.
Coulson: Not enough gunfire. Keep working. I'm on my way.
(Coulson walks out of the temple)
Coulson: Buenos dias. Soy Agente Coulson. Estamos aquí¬ por un asunto de la seguridad internacional.
Reyes: Phillip?
Coulson: Camilla? Do you mind?
Reyes: After you.
(Coulson nods to Ward that he can release the hostage, May and the soldiers lower their guns)
Reyes: And now for a proper hello.
(Reyes kisses Coulson on the cheeks)
Coulson: Comandante, a promotion. Congratulations.
Reyes: Three years ago. But thank you.
Coulson: Agent Melinda May, Agent Grant Ward, this is comandante Reyes Reyes. She's with the Policia Militar del Peru. We used to work together back in the day.
(Reyes smiles, May scoffs)
Coulson: Let the team know everything's okay.
Reyes: I know you've found a strange object on Peruvian soil. We should have a conversation about how to proceed.
Coulson: Of course. But an 0-8-4 supersedes all national claims.
Reyes: You look good.
Coulson: Yeah, I work out.
Reyes: Come, let me show you something.
(Fitz and Simmons examine the results of the drones)
Fitz: Are you seeing this? It's alive.
Skye: Wha- "alive" alive?
Fitz: It has a functioning power source.
Simmons: Sleepy's reading radionuclides, but they don't match any known isotope.
Fitz: I get temporal matches, but even then, they seem to shift. Is that even possible?
Skye: Depends on the shifting of the temporal radio stuff, so-
(Fitz and Simmons look confused)
Skye: it's totally weird, right? I'm gonna go check on Coulson.
(Ward walks in)
Ward: We've got company. National police.
Simmons: What?
Fitz: Why are they here?
Ward: They heard about this object. They're probably here to protect it. This area has lots of rebel uprisings.
Skye: Yeah, people are fighting back against the government's mining policies. It's pretty kick-ass.
Ward: Yeah. It's kick-ass, all the violence.
Skye: That's not what I'm saying.
Ward: I know it's what you're typing. In your van, alone -- where it's safe. How much longer?
Simmons: What's the hurry?
Fitz: Are we in danger?
Ward: Not if everyone does their job. What is yours, exactly?
(Ward looks at Skye)
(Coulson and Reyes walking together)
Reyes: The cacao is from a secret valley in Peru. Very special. The best chocolate in the world.
Coulson: Could use some sugar.
Reyes (sighs): Americans.
Coulson: You know me, Reyes. I'm a pretty simple guy.
Reyes: There was nothing simple about your last mission here.
Coulson: I had some great help.
Reyes: There isn't any chance we get to keep the device, is there?
Coulson: It's not mine to give, but I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this respectfully in a way that gives your count-
(A building behind them explodes, soldiers start to shoot)
Reyes: Rebels!
Coulson: Stay close, on my six.
(More explosions, gunfire and shouting)
(The temple starts to break down)
Ward: Sounds like they are engaging with rebels. Let's go! They're coming for it. Let's move!
(Skye starts to cram the drones into a box)
Fitz: No, no, no, no, no.
Skye: It doesn't matter!
Fitz: It does to me!
Simmons: Please, let us do this. We need a containment case for the 0-8-4.
Ward: There's no time!
Fitz: But it has a fluctuating power core! Frequencies way above 10 exahertz.
(Something explodes)
Ward: Sorry. Science class is over.
(Ward pulls the 0-8-4 from the wall)
Fitz: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait. You did not just pull that out of the wall. What is the matter with you?! Do you realize we do not know the amount of photon emissions coming out of this- okay. We don't know what will happen if it gets excited.
Ward: Stay close.
Simmons: Fitz! Come on!
(Coulson and Reyes running and shooting, gunfire all around them)
Coulson: Come on!
(They take cover behind a fallen table, Reyes shouts in Spanish)
Coulson: Your men need to fall back now, or we'll never make the runway. Now. Your truck. Let's go!
(Ward shoots with a pistol to keep cover for Fitz, Simmons and Skye as they get out of the temple)
Ward: Get back!
(They run back to the temple while they are getting shot at)
Coulson: Tell your men to get down.
(Reyes shouts in Spanish, Ward somersaults from the temple stairs to put a device on the ground, which creates a blue ray of energy knocking the enemies down)
Reyes: My truck!
(May pulls up with a car in front of the temple, saving the other agents from gunfire)
Ward: Get in! Get in!
May: Move! Now!
Fitz-Simmons (panting): Yeah, that's a good idea! Yes, of course!
Coulson: After you.
Reyes: After you.
(They get in the car and start getting chased)
Ward: Coulson's secure in PMP's truck. Take the south route to the airfield.
May: Gotcha.
Fitz: Slow down!
Skye: You're joking, right?
Fitz: Ward, listen! We have to be careful. There's a binding energy structure that could overheat!
Simmons: I could roll down a window!
(Rebels behind them shoot the car and they start to scream)
Skye: Do not roll down a window!
Ward: Stay quiet and keep your heads down. Head left. The ravine empties.
Fitz: But, Ward-
May and Ward: Quiet!
(May opens the ramp to the plane from the car)
Ward: How fast can you have the wheels up?
May: Fast.
(May drives the car inside the plane)
May: Ramp!
Ward: On it.
(The agents run inside, Ward starts to close the ramp)
Skye: What are you doing?! Coulson is still out there!
Ward: Get off the ramp! You're in the line of fire.
(The soldiers and Ward cover Reyes and Coulson from gunfire, as they run to the plane)
Ward: Cut it pretty close, sir.
Coulson: Didn't want to leave anyone behind.
Skye (panting):I gotta say it, I miss my van.
Ward: Now, what was the problem?
Fitz: As I said before, this device has a high-frequency, fluctuating, sub-material compression-
Ward: Fitz, in English.
Fitz: The 0-8-4 is fueled by tesseract technology. Hydra, World War II, Captain America. It's full of lethal amounts of gamma radiation.
Ward: Gamma... you're saying it's nuclear?
Coulson: No. He's saying it's much, much worse.
(Everyone steps back from the 0-8-4)
(Coulson and may sit in the cockpit)
HQ: And the 0-8-4 is in your possession?
Coulson: It's on board and contains a tesseract fuel cell, so... there's that.
HQ: Copy. You are a go for check-in guidance through restricted airspace. Safe travels.
Coulson: Top speed's a priority, May. Obviously. I know you didn't want to see combat. I apologize for that. Do you need anything else before I go check on the device fueled by evil that's sitting in our cargo hold?
(May stays quiet and flips a switch)
Coulson: This was fun.
(Coulson leaves)
(Simmons and Skye in the lab)
Simmons: Not to worry. The device is stable. Not that it couldn't explode at any minute, especially if hit with machine-gun fire. But things like this happen from time to time when in the field, and at first, it's very unpleasant, and you regret your decision to leave the lab at all-
(Fitz and Ward walk into the lab while arguing)
Fitz: Are you mental? I did explain in great detail exactly what I meant, using the Queen's bloody English!
Ward: I use normal English. Words like "duck" and "run" and "might blow us to pieces."
Fitz: Oh wow. Wow, congratulations, Agent Ward! You managed to string three words together in a sentence.
(Coulson walks downstairs)
Coulson: Is everyone all right?
Soldier: Banged up but alive. Thank you for the extraction.
Reyes: But we lost a lot of men.
Coulson: We'll make sure the rest of you get home safe.
Reyes: Are we safe on a plane with that? There's a PMP airfield in Equitos. It's a short distance-
Coulson: We'll burn as fast as we can for a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility. There's no safer place for us to go.
Soldier: Sir, if I may? You got anything to drink around here?
Coulson: Upstairs. I think you'll find it quite comfortable up there.
Reyes: I expect the grand tour.
Coulson: I know you do.
(Fitz and Ward are still arguing, Coulson steps in)
Fitz: ...we are dealing with! I'm trying to tell you-
Ward: I don't understand anything you are saying-
Coulson: Do we have a problem in here?
Ward: No, sir. Just working on our communication. Not everyone was prepared for a firefight.
(Simmons rolls her eyes)
Coulson: We got out, didn't lose anyone, saved a few of theirs... I'd say we did all right. Anything else?
(Skye raises her hand)
Skye: Uh, yeah, I have a small question. Because I've been feeling like the tagalong hayseed rookie, but now I get the sense that Ward doesn't know which one's Simmons and which one's Fitz, and they've seen even less gunfire than me, and I'm no rocket scientist, but is this your first mission together?
Simmons: No. Of course not. It's our second.
Skye: I was your first? That's sweet.
Ward: You're amused?
Skye: I'm terrified. I am in way over my head, but I have been on this team just as long as any of you. I might as well be team captain.
(The Agents look at each other in silence)
Skye: I was joking, but maybe that's not a bad idea, because these guys do not like each other much.
Ward: This isn't about that. I'm a specialist. Today, I could have eliminated the enemy threat myself if I was working alone, but I had non-combat ready agents-
Fitz: Whoa, whoa. Wait. You work alone?
Simmons: So typical. Who do you think designed your equipment?
Fitz: Or the polymers for your weaponry.
Simmons: Yeah. Try going into the field with just your bare bum!
Fitz: People like us do it.
Skye: See them proving the point I just made?
Coulson: You're not wrong. We still need to iron out the kinks. But, Ward, you can speak six languages. Simmons, you have two PhDs in fields I can't pronounce, and, Fitz, you are a rocket scientist. So work it out.
(Coulson leaves the lab)
Skye: I-I'm... I'm good at stuff, too!
(Soldiers chatting, Reyes and Coulson walking trough the plane)
Reyes: ...but really amazing to be here and have that bickering and all that stuff.
Coulson: Yeah... after you.
(Reyes and Coulson walk upstairs)
(Fitz and Simmons working in the lab)
Simmons: So, should we work or just continue to-
Fitz: I'm saying I said there would come a moment when we would regret the decision to go in the field. I didn't think that would happen in week one.
Simmons (scoffs): Oh, God. This seam in the sedimentary layers suggests some sort of molten cave-in a few decades back.
Fitz: Yeah, well, this here -- it's optical amplification. Now, I think -- well, I'm most likely dead-on -- that the Tesseratic energy excites plasma with an inverse population of energy levels.
Simmons: A laser.
Fitz: A ray of pure energy. Two terajoules. See the amplifier? We're lucky the drones didn't trigger it while we were taking electromagnetic readings. This is a weapon, powerful enough to-
Simmons: -Enough to melt through 50 feet of solid rock to bury itself. Imagine what it could do to a person!
Fitz: Yeah, or an airplane. For example.
(Ward reading a book)
Skye: "Hunger Games"?
Ward: "Matterhorn." One of hundred books my S.O. gave me that I'm just getting around to.
(Skye looks confused)
Ward: S.O.? supervising officer?
Skye: Got it. Hackers have lingo, too, but I'll pick yours up. I feel like you and me... wrong foot. Can I buy you a drink? What I said before... when I said the uprising was... Whatever I said, A good thing? I don't want you to think I'm oblivious. What I was talking about was the tweets.
Ward: Tweets... You trying to make things better or worse?
Skye: Peruvians have organized for the first time in decades. Thousands of suffering people who have never met uniting over a common idea? It's mind-blowing. And I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to see your hate face, but that's what the Rising Tide is all about.
Ward: Okay.
Skye: Usually, one person doesn't have the solution. But 100 people with 1% of the solution? That'll get it done. I think that's beautiful. Pieces solving a puzzle.
Ward: You and I see the world differently, is all.
Skye: I've never been in a war zone during a war till today. That was crazy. I take it you've seen that a lot?
(Ward sighs, takes a sip of the drink and puts it on the table, Skye sees blood on his white shirt)
Skye: Wh- did you get shot?
Ward: Skin deep, nothing to worry about.
Skye: You got shot! Did that happen protecting us?
Ward: I said don't worry about it.
Skye: Well, no wonder you were so pissed.
Ward: I wasn't pissed. I was trained to be the whole solution... to eliminate variables. And today, they keep adding up.
(Ward looks at soldiers playing cards, Skye looks around)
Skye: We're turning.
Ward: We've entered restricted airspace, so we have to follow certain flight paths. It's regulation. This plane is capable of fully automated flight, but May has to be on the stick herself tonight.
Skye: You've got an S.O., May's got to be on the stick... Lots of good lingo on this plane.
Ward: Yeah. And we just can't seem to understand each other.
(Coulson showing Reyes his antiques in his office)
Coulson: First walkie-talkie wristwatch. 1936, Poland. They only made 20, I think. Still works.
Reyes: I forgot you're such a sentimentalist, Phillip. Romanticizing history, huh.
Coulson: Yeah, most of it's glued down. There was an elegance to things back then.
Reyes: There we agree.
Coulson: With everything around us changing so quickly, it doesn't hurt to have a few touchstones to the past. Reminds me what's important.
Reyes: The last thing I want to do is relive days gone by. A few nights, maybe...
(Reyes closes the door behind her)
Coulson: I see what you're doing.
Reyes: I'm reminiscing. This plane is such a step up from the RV we used to work out of when you were stationed in Cusco.
Coulson: I don't remember much working.
(Reyes chuckles)
Coulson: I also don't remember you being this direct.
(Ward looks around him)
Ward: Skye, hand me the bottle.
Skye: Okay, Turbo, but you're still nursing the one you got.
Ward: I'm not the only one.
(A soldier walks to watch Fitz and Simmons in the lab)
(Reyes continues to flirt)
Reyes: We're stuck above the clouds for the next few hours. We might as well enjoy ourselves. We could make a few more memories to add to your collection. What do you think?
Coulson: I think Ward already knows you'll have to eliminate May from the equation to have a chance, which gives him about 20 seconds to get to her first.
(Ward gets up and starts to fight the soldiers)
(One of the soldiers puts a device on the cockpit door to release gas inside, that May would pass out)
(Reyes attacks Coulson and they run downstairs together to see Ward fight and Skye and Fitz held hostage)
Coulson: We were allies. We had history. When did you decide to throw that away?
Reyes: As soon as I saw your team.
(Coulson has been tied down, a soldiers punches him in the face and Coulson spits out blood while another soldier is flying the plane)
Coulson: The reason I'm still alive is because you need me to verify the change of routes for your pilot when H.Q. calls in any minute now.
Reyes: I'd appreciate that.
Coulson: But if I don't, S.H.I.E.L.D. will shoot this aircraft out of the sky. That'll take the 0-8-4 out of your hands. Maybe I should let them.
Reyes: Oh, no, I think you'll make the call. You already handed me your plane for the life of one of your little lab rats. If I open the cargo hold, you'll lose them all. And you are such a sentimentalist.
(Ward, Skye, Fitz and Simmons are tied down, May is still unconscious and laying on the floor)
Fitz: This is my fault. I should have learned kung fu.
Simmons: Oh, yeah, but I shouldn't have pushed you into the field in the first place. You weren't ready.
Ward: It was my job to make a proper threat assessment.
Simmons: Uh, we -- We weren't ready.
Skye: This wouldn't have happened if Agent May wasn't on the stick. She would have busted out some of her ninja know-how.
Fitz: Agent May? No, no, no. She transferred from administration.
Skye: Well, I've seen her destroy a guy, so...
(They all turn to look at Ward)
Ward: You've heard of the cavalry?
Simmons: Yeah.
Fitz: Yeah. Wh- everyone at the academy talks about st-
Fitz and Simmons: She's the cavalry!
May: I told you never to call me that.
(All turn to look at May)
Simmons: I can't believe it. Oh, we're sure to get out of here now. Um, how do we get out of here?
May: Can't go through the doors. They're bolted, tied to the pressurization lines. You two geniuses have nothing?
Fitz: Yeah, well, it's hard to concentrate in these intense situations.
Ward: Hey. Don't freeze up. Take a breath. You don't need to come up with the whole solution. Just part of it. Right?
(Skye nods and smiles)
Skye: Yeah. Pieces solving a puzzle.
Coulson: You knew this was a weapon all along.
Reyes: But you got to it first. I had to play nice. Yes, Coulson. For once, I'm actually ahead of you. My country commissioned that weapon decades ago. After the fall of Hydra, many scientists followed their Nazi friends to hide on this side of the world.
Coulson: German engineering.
Reyes: The weapon was lost during a clash in the jungle until today. With it, we'll end the rebel uprising and finally stabilize my country.
Coulson: You mean rule your country.
Reyes: You stay in your borders, I'll stay in mine.
Coulson: Those borders are disappearing. Aliens descended on New York, remember? They don't care whose colors you wear, they just care who's in the way. We should be working together, not fighting.
Simmons: Well, that's clearly the worst idea we've heard yet.
Skye: But it could work.
Ward: Reyes is gonna kill us the minute we land, regardless. Blame it on rebels. This way, we have a fighting chance. I'll take it. What's first?
Fitz: We can't get upstairs without going in the lab.
Simmons: And the only way to release the lab doors is from upstairs.
Skye: The first thing is, we're tied to the cargo doors, so unless you can-
(May cracks her hand)
Fitz: What the hell was that?
Ward: Her wrist.
(A soldier is guarding the agents, but May drops him over the railing before he can even notice)
May: What's next?
Reyes: Was it 11 years ago, now? You swooped in with S.H.I.E.L.D. with so much confidence, so much mystery. You had 100 men at your disposal. And now-
Coulson: A hand-picked team. And, yes, they're that good.
Reyes: Oh, Phil. You're not even aware. Your renewed idealism, your collectibles, your airborne man-cave, surrounding yourself with young, attractive agents... you're having a mid-life crisis.
Coulson: More an afterlife thing, really.
Reyes: And I'm not going to even mention the red Corvette.
Coulson: Her name's Lola.
Reyes: Of course it is. It's textbook. You built this team so you could feel relevant, to feel needed.
Coulson: They don't need me. They need time.
Reyes: Well, time is not on their side.
Coulson: No, but you gave them something better; a common enemy.
(Skye, Ward, Fitz and Simmons discussing their plan)
Skye: Okay, we're sure, right? Everyone's sure?
Simmons: We're all on board.
Fitz: Yeah, let's do this fast.
Ward: No turning back. No freezing up.
Fitz: Because if we do, then...
Ward: All of us die.
Simmons: We know.
Fitz: Yeah.
Ward: All right.
(May starts the engine of a car)
May: You guys talk a lot.
(The others move aside as May drives the car trough the lab door)
(Reyes hears the crash and starts shouting in Spanish)
(The agents downstairs start to execute their plan)
HQ: S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6, we have radar contact. Requesting confirmation on a change in course. Over.
(Reyes points a gun at Coulson)
Reyes: Answer it, or they all learn what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.
HQ: Agent Coulson, are you there? You have course confirmation. You are cleared direct to the Slingshot.
(Coulson has almost untied himself, but sees a drone coming and ties himself back)
HQ: Agent Coulson? Everything all right up there? We heard you had a little dustup on the ground.
Coulson: Yeah, we're all good. It's gonna be blue skies from here on out.
(Fitz is controlling the drones from a tablet)
Fitz: Simmons? Forget what I said before. This is the moment that we'll regret.
(The drone activates the 0-8-4 and it blows up a hole on the side of the plane)
(People scream and one of the soldiers flies out of the hole)
(Coulson is hanging on a rope while more stuff gets sucked outside)
Skye: It worked!
Simmons: The drop in cabin pressure released the doors.
Ward: I'll take care of the soldiers. You guys get to the 0-8-4.
Fitz: And Coulson?
Ward: Let's hope he can handle himself.
(The agents go upstairs, Ward starts to fight against the armed soldiers)
Ward: Go now! Find the 0-8-4!
(Skye, Fitz and Simmons are tied to a rope so they don't fly out, Fitz falls over)
Fitz: Help!
(May gets in the cockpit to fight the soldier controlling the plane)
(Reyes is about to die, but Coulson takes her hand)
Reyes: Coulson!
Coulson: Got you! Hold on! It's okay.
(Simmons pulls the 0-8-4 from the plane wall where it flew when it was activated)
Simmons: I've got it! Fitz!
Skye: We got it, reel us back in!
Fitz: I've got you!
(The brochure flies into Skye's face, and she unbuckles herself from the rope)
Simmons: What are you doing? We need your help!
Skye: Trust me!
(Coulson ties Reyes up)
Coulson: Don't want you to know what a 30,000-foot drop feels like.
(May fights more soldiers in the cockpit and takes control)
(Skye pulls out a yellow bag from an emergency box)
(Rest of the team keep struggling to keep the 0-8-4 safe, one of the soldiers grabs onto the rope that is still attached to Fitz and Simmons)
Simmons: Aah! Cut him loose!
(Fitz takes the rope of and the soldier almost gets sucked out, but grabs Wards hand)
Fitz: Sorry!
Simmons: Sorry Ward!
Ward: Hold on!
(Ward grabs his shirt, but it rips and the soldier flies out of the plane)
(Skye opens the yellow bag and a rubber boat fills itself with air and blocks the hole, saving Ward)
(One last soldier tries to reach a pistol but Coulson steps on his hand and punches him in the face)
(Everyone is panting but relieved, Skye helps Ward get up)
Skye: I read the safety pamphlet.
Ward: I think you might be the first.
Coulson: No other way in, huh? I was just starting to warm up to this place.
(Coulson puts a broken glass on the table, Skye picks it up and put a coaster under it)
Fitz: The 0-8-4 is cooling and stable. But we should call H.Q. and get it to the Slingshot as soon as possible.
(Coulson leaves to talk to Reyes)
Coulson: Told you they were good.
(The team lands to The Slingshot, Coulson is checking on Lola)
Skye: Not a scratch. But your plane's totaled. I hope S.H.I.E.L.D. insurance covers hijackings.
Coulson: Sure. Under "incidentals".
Skye: What exactly am I signing up for?
Coulson: Like I said; front-row seat to the craziest show on earth.
Skye: Yeah, but I didn't expect the show to get this crazy this fast all for an object you're just gonna destroy.
Coulson: Slingshot is protocol. A weapon like the 0-8-4 is too dangerous for any person or country to have. People like Reyes would always be after it.
Skye: What happened with Reyes, anyway?
Coulson: She's being held at a S.H.I.E.L.D. detainment facility. I expect the Peruvian government will negotiate for her release. She probably won't spend much time in jail.
Skye: No, I mean what happened with you and Reyes? You guys totally did it back in the day, right?
Coulson: That's classified.
(Ward and May discuss about Skye)
Ward: Looks like Skye might end up as more than just a consultant, despite our reservations.
(May nods)
Ward: She could turn into a solid asset with some serious work.
May: Well, if she wants to be a field agent, she'll need a supervising officer. Someone disciplined, someone good.
(May looks at Ward)
Ward: All right. I'll do it... Just to clarify, you were, uh, talking about me, right?
(May smiles)
(Fitz and Simmons walk down the stairs with beers and a cooler)
Fitz: We blew up a plane.
Simmons: I had a new experience.
Fitz: Eat that, Professor Vaughn.
Simmons: You had a new experience. But it was new for all of us.
May: They're happy.
Fitz: Hey, come on. You guys don't want to miss this.
(The team sits down on the plane ramp to watch the 0-8-4 get shot in space)
Fitz: So, it'll take about 180 days to reach the sun. Now, yes, of course, it would have been faster if they'd used hydrogen-fueled APUs, but they're having fun.
Skye: How many of those have you guys had?
(Simmons chuckles)
Simmons: Sk- Skye. It's important when in the field to unwind from time to time.
Fitz: Yeah, yeah, especially after a hard day of everyone almost dying.
Simmons: Which doesn't happen every day, right? It's an anomaly- an irregularity. Not the norm.
Coulson: Speaking of "not the norm," whose idea was it to blow a hole in the plane?
(The agents look at each other in silence thinking they are in trouble)
Skye: May said that the doors were tied to the pressurization, so I thought-
Simmons: So we thought it was the only way to release them.
Ward: It was everyone's idea, sir.
Fitz:Yes, quite genius, really.
Coulson: Nice work.
Man (from distance) All clear for liftoff.
Fitz: Oh, time for blastoff.
Fitz (nasally): Launching in three... two...
(Simmons laughs, the rocket launches)
Fitz: The trajectory will take it beyond the Lagrange point so that it doesn't hit Herschel.
Simmons: And there haven't been any coronal mass ejections, so it shouldn't lose telemetry.
Ward: Guys, English.
(Ward taps Fitz on the back)
Fitz: Ow.
(Skye's phone buzzes, she gets a message asking what her status is, she answers "I'm in" but looks worried)
(Nick Fury and Coulson talk inside the wrecked plane)
Nick Fury: Really? Really, Coulson? Six days? It only took you six days to take a completely renovated piece of state-of-the-art machinery and turn it into scrap?!
Coulson: My team acted with my authority.
Fury: Don't talk to me about authority. Do you know how much this plane cost? It's got a bar. A really nice one. Talking to me about authority. You know, I have the authority to downgrade your ass to a Winnebago.
Coulson: I'm aware of that, sir.
Fury: Well, I want it fixed just like you found it. So don't have Fitz-Simmons going making modifications, like a-a-a-a damn fish tank.
Coulson: Yes, sir.
Fury: And the new girl... she's a risk.
Coulson: I know, sir.
Fury: You know, sir? How's Lola?
Coulson: She's fine, sir. Thanks for asking.
(Fury walks away)
Fury (to himself): Talking to me about authority.
Coulson (on the phone): Yeah, we're gonna have to kill the fish tank.
