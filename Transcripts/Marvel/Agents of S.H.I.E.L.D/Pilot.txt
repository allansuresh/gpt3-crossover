[Cut to a montage of New York City skyscrapers and streets, with occasional flashes to the Battle of New York, all the while Skye narrates over it]
Skye: [voice-over] The secret is out. For decades, your organization stayed in the shadows, hiding the truth. But now we know they're among us. Heroes and monsters. The world is full of wonders.
Mike Peterson: Thanks, Bernie.
Bernie: You bet.
Mike: Ace, come and get it. What do you say we go out to your aunt Mindy's this weekend? You and Kisha can swim in the pond.
Ace: Sure.
Mike: You know, you got a birthday coming up in a couple of months. Who's your favorite?
Ace: I'm okay.
Mike: Hey. Things are tight right now, but I'm gonna find something. Not back at the factory, but I got prospects. You and me what are we?
Ace: We're a team.
Mike: That's right. So, who do you-
(A building nearby explodes)
Mike: Are you okay? All right, ace, look at me. I need you to stay here with Bernie, okay? People might be hurt, and I'm gonna see if they need my help. Stay with Bernie. Watch my boy!
Debbie: Help me! Help me!! Aah! Help me! Help me!
(Mike uses his superpowers to save Debbie and then leaves in a hurry)
Skye: [voice-over] We can't explain everything we see. But our eyes are open. So what now? There are no more shadows for you to hide in. Something impossible just happened. What are you going to do about it?
(Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. logo shows on the screen)
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent: Agent Ward, there's been a development. It's The Rising Tide. They've pinned down the location of the package. We need to abort.
Grant Ward: I'm five minutes away from retrieving it.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent: So is everyone else. They posted the coordinates online.
Ward: If the job was easy-
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent: Yeah, it wouldn't be any fun. Watch your six.
(Ward enters a restaurant and dresses as an employee)
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent: Red tie, by the window.
Ward: Puis-je prendre votre verre, monsieur?
(Ward goes up the stirs and retrieves an aliens object from a secret room behind a fireplace. He then turns around to see a woman standing in front of him.)
Ward: Your fireplace is broken.
(Three man enter the room and start fighting with Ward)
S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent: Ward, just a heads-up. We've got possible hostiles in your vicinity.
Ward: Really?
(Ward knocks the men unconscious and escapes in a helicopter. He returns to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters)
Maria Hill: What does "S.H.I.E.L.D." stand for, agent Ward?
Ward: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Hill: And what does that mean to you?
Ward: It means someone really wanted our initials to spell out "SHIELD". It means we're the line between the world and the much weirder world. We protect people from news they aren't ready to hear. And when we can't do that, we keep them safe. Something turns up Like this Chitauri neural link We get to it before someone bad does.
Hill: Any idea who Vanchat was planning to sell it to?
Ward: I'm more interested in how this Rising Tide group found out about it. I thought they were just hackers. What changed?
Hill: Everything's changing. A little while ago, most people went to bed thinking that the craziest thing in the world Was a billionaire in a flying metal suit. Then aliens invaded New York and were beaten back by, among others, a giant green monster, a costumed hero from the '40s, and a god.
Ward: I don't think Thor's technically a god.
Hill: Well, you haven't been near his arms. The battle of New York was the end of the world. This now is the new world. People are different. They have access to tech, to formulas, secrets they're not ready for.
Ward: Why was I pulled out of Paris?
Hill: That, you'll have to ask agent Coulson.
Ward: Uh, yeah. I'm clearance Level 6. I know that Agent Coulson was killed in action before the battle of New York. Got the full report.
Phil Coulson: Welcome to Level 7. Sorry that corner was really dark, and I couldn't help myself. I think there's a bulb out.
Ward: Director Fury faked your death, to motivate the avengers.
Hill: Well, the death of a common ally Is a particularly effective team builder.
(They stop in front of a sealed door and turn towards a wall. A femake computer voice speaks.)
Computer:Say “cheese”.
Phil Coulson: Plus, it wasn’t that much of a stretch. I stopped breathing for about 40 seconds.Hill: Eight. It gets longer every time you tell it.
Coulson: Yeah, well you get shanked by the Asgardian Mussolini, you can tell it your way.
(They have entered some sort of reception area.)
Coulson: I was looking at the big white light and it felt like a lot longer than 8 seconds.
(Coulson and Ward both get badges that they clip to their jackets. Once they do they all begin to walk again.)
Ward: Do they know? The Avengers, that Fury played them?
Hill: They’re not level 7. 
Coulson: I got out of the I.C.U., Fury stuck me in a grass shack in Tahiti. Rough gig. Mai tais, Travis McGee novels and a physical therapist whose command of English was…irrelevant.
They enter a room filled with computer and monitors.
Ward: But something put you back in the game.
(Something beeps when they enter the room and a video is played on one of the screens. It’s the footage the Cellphone Woman took of the Man jumping out of the building.)
Ward: What’s that?
Coulson: That’s a superhero, Agent Ward.
Hill: An unregistered gifted. Identity unknown.
(We hear a few more beeps and the woman who did the voiceover at the top of the episode is speaking again.)
Skye: Your secret is out. For decades your organization…
(Her voice is drown out by other voices and different clips playing on the screens.)
Coulson: Another little present from the Rising Tide.
Ward: How are they getting this stuff before us?
Coulson: Same way they cracked our RSA implementation. They’re good. So I need better.
Hill: Agent Coulson has requisitioned a mobile command unit, to which you are assigned.
Coulson: Rising Tide is trying to draw us out. I think it’s time they succeeded.
Ward: You want me to cross them off?
Coulson: Wow. No. I want to use them to get to him. This man’s world is about to get very weird. He’s gonna need some help.
Ward: I’m sorry, I was trained from day one as a specialist. I go in alone, I get it done. Defusing a nuclear bomb – I’m your guy. A welcoming committee? Not my speed.
Coulson: I know it’s not what you want. Agent Hill did a very detailed assessment of your last three missions. Combat – top grades. Espionage – she gave you the highest marks since Romanoff. Under “people skills” she drew a – I think it’s a little poop. With knives sticking out of it.
Hill: What? 
Coulson: That’s bad, right? And given your family history, I’m surprised it’s not worse. I think you’re the guy for this. If I’m wrong, you go straight back to your bombs.
(An older man walks into the room wearing a lab coat.)
Older Man: Teams approved. Physicals are all fine. Fitz-Simmons is not cleared for combat. I’m told that won’t be an issue. Agent Ward here, he’s almost too fit.
Ward: That’s an issue. That should be an issue. Maybe I can’t join the team. Because my – 
Hill: God, you are dismissed.
(Ward walks out of the room)
Hill: It was a porcupine, it was not a poop. It just means that he – 
Coulson: No, I’m pretty sure.
Hill: And it’s not just Ward, your whole roster is sketchy.
Coulson: Well, they’re cleared.
Older Man: I would’ve been very happy not to clear you, Phil. I’d love for you to rest up some more. 
Coulson: I’ve had plenty of that, thanks.
Hill: You sure? 
Coulson: You should go sometime. 
Hill: Where?
Coulson: Tahiti. It’s a magical place.
Hill: Three days in and I’d be begging for an assignment.
Coulson: Exactly.
(Coulson walks out of the room)
Older Man: Tahiti. He really doesn’t know, does he?
Hill: He can never know.
(Open inside a diner. The superhero man from earlier is sitting in a booth drinking coffee and watching the news. The report has a runner at the bottom that says “who is the hooded hero”. Thy are talking to the woman that he saved in the building.)
Debbie: Is there any way I can thank him? Are you sure, nobody saw him?
Reporter: So, the identity of the hooded hero still remains unknown.
Skye: Just act natural.
Mike: What? 
Skye: Just, pretend that we’re talking.
Mike: We are.
Skye: Good, cause you never know who’s listening.
Mike: I don’t even know who’s talking.
Skye: I’m Skye. And you’re the hooded hero. Please tell me that you’re not staying with that name.
Mike: Wait, what? I’m not – I’m a factory worker.
Skye: Sure, by day. I saw you. You’re a hero. Like, a for real superhero – which is – I’m not, a groupie, stalker type, but… Oh my God, that is so cool! Okay, okay, chill. Just don’t, don’t draw attention. You’re in danger.
Mike: You got the wrong guy, lady.
Skye: No, you’ve got the wrong approach. The cute girl from the hospital is dying to thank you, and possibly “thank” you. And you’re hiding. The clip of you rescuing her has had the most hits since that puppy with vertigo, and you can’t even find a job.
Mike: What do you mean about danger?
Skye: S.H.I.E.L.D.
Mike: Shield what? I should carry a shield?
Skye: S.H.I.E.L.D. Government. Scary men in dark suits who come after guys like you. They knew about the Battle of New York before it even happened. And then cleaned it up before anyone could ask real questions – overnight. How long do you think it’ll take for them to clean you up?
Mike: And you want to know why I’m hiding.
Skye: What if you didn’t hide? What if you got in front of this and let people know that you’re a hero?
Mike: I’m just a guy.
Skye: Why, a guy like that gets work, gets perks. I can help. I’m great with computers – like weirdly great. I mean, I could help you create a whole new identity or… A mask.
Mike: O-okay.
Skye: Well, you could just – also we could just stick with the… Hood. Listen, you cannot walk away from this. With great power comes…a ton of weird crap that you are not prepared to deal with. Now, my office is – 
Mike: You have an office?
Skye: Yes, I have an office. It’s a mobile…office. It’s a…van. I live in a van – by choice! But, it’s always in the alley around the corner, free Wi-Fi and you can come by anytime.
Mike: Thank you.
Skye: They’re coming for you. …Mike.
(Cut to inside an office.)
Coulson: Agent May.
May: No.
Coulson: So, you’ve been briefed.
May: I’m not going back in the field.
Coulson: Yeah, you got such a nice setup here. Ever thought about adding a moat? I just need you to drive the Bus, liaise ground transport, some on-site supervision. This isn’t a combat op.
May: Then you don’t need me.
Coulson: I do. Cause we’ll be running ourselves. Picking the ops, making the calls. No red tape. This is where they actually make the red tape, isn’t it? I always wondered. Melinda?
May: You’re really just asking me to drive the Bus?
Coulson: I’m not asking. But it’s a really nice Bus.
(Cut to outside, we round a truck to see a hanger with a large plane waiting inside.)
Fitz: Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch it! That’s the Night-Night Gun.
Simmons: Well it’s on my stuff, and it doesn’t work, and there’s no way we’re calling it the Night-Night Gun.
Fitz: The bullets work. Nonlethal, heavy stopping power, break up under the subcutaneous tissue – 
Simmons: Oh, with a dose of only .1 microliters of Dendrotoxin. I’m not Hermione. I can’t create instant paralysis with that.You should have run the specs by me before building the molds.
Fitz: The bullets are hollow. It’s a marvel I can keep them from breaking apart in the chamber.
Simmons: Or used a higher caliber round or read a book.
Fitz: Have you ever heard of physicist or – uh what’s the other one? Inertia.
Simmons: It’s not particularly difficult.
Ward: Fits-Simmons?
(Simmons points at Fitz.)
Simmons: Fitz.
(Fitz points at the Simmons.)
Fitz: Simmons. I’m engineering, she’s biochem. Agent Ward? 
Ward: Coulson said I’d need my comm receiver encoded. I don’t know if you’ve worked with that model before. It’s –  Brand new.
Simmons: He’ll repurpose the I.D.I.S. chip.
Fitz: Don’t need the external receiver for the inner-ear coms anymore.
Ward: So, uh, how does it – 
Simmons: Embedded sensorineural silicone matched to your DNA. It’s very posh. So, are you excited to be coming on our journey into mystery?
Ward (dryly): It’s like Christmas.
(A shiny bright red Corvette rolls into the plane.)
Fitz: One of Coulson’s old S.H.I.E.L.D. collectables. Flamethrowers, world’s first GPS. He’s mad for this crap.
Coulson: Don’t touch Lola.
Fitz: And he calls it a girl’s name.
Coulson: Lola’s not just a collectable, you know. People tend to confuse the words “new” and “Improved”.
This is mobile command, they were in heavy rotation back in the 90s, but then we got a heli-carrier. Hey, did you hear the one about the guy who’s afraid of flying?
Ward: I’ve done a night jump into a drop zone under heavy fire, sir. I can handle it.
Coulson: That was a…joke. The first part of a… I’m not gonna tell it now.
May: If you plan to unpack, make it quick. Wheels are up in five. We may have a hit on one of the Rising Tide’s routing points.
Coulson: Good, we need to do some catching up.
Ward: Is that…who I think it is?
Coulson: She’s just the pilot.
Ward: Melinda May is “just the pilot”? Come on, sir. What game are you really playing?
Coulson: Better stow your gear.
(Plane exits the hanger)
Skye: [voice-over] How will you come at us? From the air? From the ground? How will you silence us this time? How can you? The truth is in the wind. It’s everywhere. You cannot stop the Rising Tide. You will not find us. You will never see our faces. But, rest assured, we will rise against those who shields us from the truth. And nothing – nothing – can stop us in the – 
(The door to her right opens suddenly cutting her off, standing there is a smiling Coulson.)
Skye: Hey. What up?
(Cut to in the plane)
Skye: You guys are making a big mistake.
Ward: You don’t look that big.
Coulson: Sorry for the lack of finesse. Agent Ward here has had a little history with your group – The Rising Tide.
Skye: I don’t know... what you’re-
Ward: Okay, there are two ways we can do this.
Skye: Oh, is one of them the easy way?
Ward: No.
Skye: Oh.
Coulson: What’s your name?
Skye: Skye.
Ward: What’s your real name?
Coulson: That can wait. It’s another name we need, a certain hero.
Skye: What makes you think I know that?
Coulson: Well, you made a little mistake. The phone you filmed the hooded hero with had the same cryptographic signature as a few of the Rising Tide posts.
Skye: Wow. Yeah. Was that a mistake? Or am I now sitting in the center of your secret headquarters? What is this? A plane? I got inside. And, by now, you’ve discovered you can’t beat the encryption on my equipment, so you got nothing.
Coulson: We have a fairly strong coincidence. You being on the scene right before it went up in flames. Want to tell me what my team is gonna find out? How did you know the hooded man was in the building?
Ward: Did you blow it up to draw him out?
Skye: Did you?
Coulson: That’s not our style.
Skye: I was just kidnapped by your “style”. S.H.I.E.L.D. covered up New Mexico, Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Of course you’d be covering up Centipede. Holy- No way. You don’t know what that is. Billions of dollars of equipment at your disposal and I beat you with a laptop I won in a bet?
Coulson: You need to think about your friend. We’re not the only ones interested in people with powers. We’d like to contain him, yeah. The next guy will want to exploit him and the guy after that will want to dissect him.
Ward: What is centipede?
Mike (ON PHONE): Yeah, I get it, but… Listen doctor, people saw me. They saw what I can do. If I went public that might be good. I mean, your product works. It works amazingly and Yeah, yeah, I-I-I know what I signed, but if we got out in front of this, maybe – Then what? You want me to go crawling back to the factory? I couldn’t even get workmen’s comp from those crooks. I don’t think – Yeah, yeah, doctor, I just thought – okay.
Simmons: This was a lab. Was this leased as a lab?
May: Self-empowerment center. With a top of the line motion sensor security system.
Simmons: Ah, so a secret lab. I don’t think it is, I mean wouldn’t that have been removed by now? But it sure does look like a hand sticking up in the air.
May: And a superhero, not a coincidence. So, was this explosion sabotage? Was it meant for him?
(May notices what Simmons is doing, taking a sample from whatever she’s kneeling next to with a large set of tweezers.)
May: Or were they just in over their heads?
(Fitz has walked over to join them.)
Fitz: Yeah, working the problem. Ladies, if you’ll just.
(He walks between them then sets down his case and opens it.)
May: If you’re gonna be in the field, Agent Fitz, you have to get your hands dirty.
Fitz: No, I don’t.
(He’s looking down at some sort of tablet and we hear beeping sound followed by a whirring sound. Small little drone planes fly up around him as he sings the “Off to Work” song from Snow White. He hits a few more buttons and the drones emit some sort of laser grid to map the room.)
(We cut back to Coulson, Ward and Skye. Skye is standing and pacing around as Coulson and Ward sit.)
Skye: Centipede, it was chatter on the web and then, gone. I traced the access point MAC address to that building.
Ward: What were you after?
Skye: The truth. What are you after?
Ward: World peace. You pseudo-anarchist hacker types love to stir things up.
(Ward stands and Skye gives him a surprised look at his words.)
Ward: But you’re never around for the fallout. People keep secrets for a reason, Skye.
(Ward is now standing very close to her and towering over her, but to her credit she has not backed down. Instead she puts one of her hands to his chest and pushes him back a step.)
Skye: Well, just because you’re reasonable and...
(She pauses and pushes him again.)
Skye: Firm... doesn’t mean that you’re not an evil, faceless government tool bag.
(Ward seems to be exasperated.)
Ward: Just give us your guy’s name.)
Skye: He’s not my guy!
Coulson: You understand he’s in danger.
Skye: Then let me go! Let me talk to him. Me, not the T-1000 here.
(She had, of course, motion to Ward with her insult.)
Ward: You want to be alone with him. Of course.
(He turns away from her and looks at Coulson.)
Ward: She’s a groupie. All this hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D., tracking powers, she might as well be one of those sweaty cosplay girls crowding around Stark Tower.
(Skye looks insulted as Coulson stands up.)
Skye: What?!? I would –
(Her face goes from indignant to resigned.)
Skye: It was one time.
(Coulson has walked to the door and opened it, then he turns and looks behind himself.)
Coulson: Ward.
(He walks into the hallway with Ward following after closing the door.)
Coulson: Is it the girl? She getting under your skin?
Ward: Sir?
Coulson: Or is it the assignment? Are you so anxious to get out of this that you'd deliberately blow an interrogation?
Ward: Give me a minute alone with her, you'll have your answers.
Coulson: She's an asset.
Ward: She is such an a—
(What Coulson says sinks in.)
Ward: Wait, asset?
Coulson: We don’t know anything about her.
(While they’ve been talking Coulson opens a door and takes out a small case. He puts the case on the table.)
Coulson: Do you appreciate how often that happens? That never happens. We need what she knows.
(Coulson opens the case and we see some sort of tech gun sitting inside.)
(Cut to the bombed out building. Fitz is holding onto a big pad flying his drones around the room taking video while Simmons and May talk.)
Simmons: See, we designed each with their own capabilities, so, um, some recording the dimensions and texture of the rooms and then some are testing the matter density, radiation. I mean, one is basically just smelling.
(Fitz sees something on his giant tablet and calls out.)
Fitz: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I’ve got something in something.
(The camera flips to the view of one of the drones. The description at the top says “04 bashful”.)
Simmons: Who’s got it?
(Fitz turns around and points.)
Fitz: Uh, bashful.
(May walks over to where the drone is moving things around. She finds a black cylinder and picks it up.)
May: Surveillance camera. Deep fried.
Fitz: Yes, but that model has flash memory in case of brownouts. Now, I could sync that data from the motion detectors and, with a little luck, get some images from before the blast. And by “luck” I mean “unappreciated genius”.
(May gives him a smirk as Simmons walks closer to them.)
Simmons: Yeah, we’ll need it. Snow’s reading some compounds that are – whoa. My God.
(She walks over to another section of the room and looks down then bends down.)
May: Explosive?
(Simmons finds something on the floor and picks it up.)
Simmons: Not of this earth.
(Cut back to inside the small room on the plane. Coulson holds up a tiny vial of green liquid before Skye.)
Coulson: This is QNB-T16. It’s the top shelf martini of sodium pentothal derivatives.
(Coulson places the vial inside the gun we saw earlier. Skye shifts in her seat but Ward has his hand on her shoulder restraining her.)
Coulson: It’s a brand new and extremely potent truth drug. Don’t worry. The effects only last about an hour.
(Ward releases her and walks to stand next to Coulson.)
Ward: And you’ll have a nice little nap. And we’ll have all the answers to our – Hey!
(Coulson has turned toward Ward and shot him with the drug instead of Skye.)
Ward: What the hell?!?
Coulson: I’m sorry, did that hurt?
(Ward takes his hand away from the place in his arm where he was shot putting on bravado.)
Ward: No. But you’ve lost your mind. You should never do that to a member of your team. And yes, it did hurt a little bit. But I always try to mask my pain in front of beautiful women...
(He shoots Skye a look as her eyebrows raise in surprise.)
Ward: Because I think it makes me seem more masculine. My God, this stuff works fast!
(He looks down at his arm realizing that he’s under the influence of the truth drug. He sits down in the vacant chair.)
Coulson: Don’t trust us? Ask him whatever you’d like.
(Coulson starts to move toward the door.)
Ward: Wait a minute. Wait, you can’t just – this is definitely not protocol!
(Coulson shuts the door in Ward’s face. Skye cocks her head looking at Ward. She slowly takes her coat off. Ward’s eyes glance down for a moment then focus on her eyes.)
Skye: You seem nervous, Agent Ward.
Ward: I’m calling to mind my training.
(Skye stands up.)
Ward: There’s no way I’m going to reveal classified secrets to a girl who’s hell bent on taking us down.
(Skye is now standing right next to Ward and leans down a bit putting her hands on the table.)
Skye: Have you ever killed anyone?
Ward: Yes, a few.
(He closes his eyes in frustration.)
Ward: High risk targets. But they were terrible people who were trying to murder nice people. And I didn’t feel good afterwards.
Skye: And does your grandmother know about these things?
(Ward’s face goes sad and he looks up at Skye, when he speaks his voice sounds like that of a child.)
Ward: Gramzy?
(Cut to inside what looks like a factory. Mike is walking behind another man who is talking to him.)
Man: My hands are tied, Mike. It’s company policy. You didn’t meet quota, I had to let you go.
(Mike hurries his steps to walk beside the guy who stops to talk to him.)
Mike: Gary, look, I got no choice. It’s just me and my boy now.
Gary: There’s no openings, Mike. And even if there were I got a hundred guys standing in line that are just like you, only they won’t bitch when they hurt back hurts.
Mike: I was injured, but I’m stronger now. I can handle twice the load I used to.
Gary: What are you not hearing? You don’t cut it.
(Mike’s face gets angry.)
Gary: When I say I need things moved I need –
(Mike angrily shoves a large crate sending it flying into a wall where sparks erupt.)
Mike: Like that?
Gary: Are you out of your mind?!?
(Mike puts his hand on Gary’s face and gives him a hard shove causing him to land on a pile of metal tubing. He’s pretty busted up and bleeding from the head.)
Mike: These are people, Gary. Men! Not parts you replace when they break.
(Mike grabs a gas container, it sprays when he rips it from wherever it was housed.)
Gary: It’s not me, man. It’s the company. I’m not the bad guy. I’m not the bad guy, man.
(Mike is looking at him and seems to get some sort of realization.)
Mike: Yes, you are. It’s simple now, just like we used to read about. You’re the bad guy.
(Gary has regained some of his composure and is now trying to move himself away from Mike.)
Mike: And I’m the hero.
(Mike lifts the gas canister high and brings it down heavily.)
(We open back with The Bus. Cut inside to show the security camera footage from the room where Skye was held. We see Ward is asleep face down on the table. When we pan away from the feed we see Coulson leaning over a lit table staring down at it as Skye walks into the room.)
Coulson: Did Agent Ward give you anything?
Skye: He told me he’s been to Paris, but never really seen it and that he wishes you had stayed in Tahiti.
Coulson: It’s a magical place.
Skye: Ward doesn’t like your style.
(Skye looks around the room with a smile.)
Skye: I kinda think I do.
Coulson: What about his?
(He sweeps his hand along the table and a feed from a news report is shown on one of the TV screens.)
Reporter: …Remains in critical condition. Employees could not identify the attacker, but security footage confirms that this man assaulted the factory foreman before damaging thousands of dollars’ worth of company property.
(When she says “security footage” that footage is shown on the TV, it shows Mike looking angry as he grabs the gas canister. Skye looks on with a worried face.)
Skye: This is wrong. This is not…the guy I met…he was…He just needs a break.
Coulson: Then give him one. What have you got?
(Skye looks from Coulson to the screen then back to Coulson again. We next see Mike’s drivers’ license being put on a lit table. A scan of the license happens and various information spread out on the table, almost like a giant touch screen computer that his horizontal instead of vertical. Fitz, Simmons and May are all around the table looking at the information with Skye standing toward the back.)
Coulson: Mike Peterson, factor worker, married, one kid. Gets injured, gets laid off. Wife jumps ship. Good guy, bad breaks.
(When Coulson gets close to the table Skye moves up as well to stand between him and May.)
Coulson: Best guess is, somebody tells him they can make him strong again, make him super.
May: Who has the tech to do that? And why would they want to?
Coulson: Fitz, what do we have from the security footage before the blast?
(Fitz touches some controls and fees a grainy looking image to one of the TV screens behind them.)
May: What are we seeing?
(What we appear to see is two men arguing. Or at least one angry man, he’s pointing his finger at the other man, it looks threatening.)
Fitz: Well the man is angry at the other man.
(They all shoot a “no kidding, really?” look at Fitz, who seems to ignore it. Simmons tries to explain.)
Simmons: The data is very corrupt.
Fitz: Yeah, like cold war Russia corrupt.
Simmons: Yeah.
Fitz: I can’t sync the timecode without –
(Skye cuts him off.)
Skye: What if you had the audio?
(Fitz turns to fully look at her, possibly for the first time.)
Skye: I was running surveillance on the lab. I had my shotgun mike pointed at the window before the blast. The digital file’s in my van. There’s too much background noise for me, but you could probably –
(This time Simmons interrupts Skye.)
Simmons: You can clean that up, can’t you? Find a sync point and use cross field validation, to find –
Fitz: But I can’t scrub for expression patterns when the Vit-C is all –
Simmons: Well, is there a chrominance subcarrier?
(While they speak their own language Skye and May watch confused.)
Fitz: Yeah, attached to the back porch, brilliant.
(Fitz and Simmons both speak over each other to Skye:)
Fitz: Um, that audio would be great. Thank you, very much.
Simmons: We will take that audio, please.
Coulson: Your van’s here, but you were right, we couldn’t decrypt the files.
Skye: The encryptions coupled to the GPS. Get my van back to that alley and then I’m in business.
(Skye starts out of the room.)
Coulson: Agent May will escort you.
(May follows after but Coulson stops her at the door.)
Coulson: And on your way out, wake up Ward.
(May nods and exits as Coulson turns to stare at the screens.)
(Cut to inside a hospital, a woman lies in the bed as a nurse attends to her. Some appears at the door holding flowers. The door opens and Mike enters the room, the woman sits up higher.)
Woman: You – you’re…Oh wow, you’re him.
(He gives her a smile and walks further into the room holding the flowers out to her as the nurse walks out.)
Mike: I’m glad you’re doing okay.
Woman: Oh, yeah.
(She takes the flowers from him, just staring at him.)
Woman: Thank you, they’re beautiful.
(Once the door closes behind the nurse she looks at him more seriously.)
Woman: What the hell are you doing here?
Mike: I don’t know where to go, doctor. Everything’s getting…I – I know what’s right, I do. But no one will listen to me. I volunteered because you said things would change.
(She quickly gets out of bed.)
Woman: And you said you could keep it together. Our first subject lost it, walked into the lab with a fricking bomb.
Mike: I’m not like him.
Woman: Well, tell that to your foreman, in the I.C.U.
(He grips her shoulder pulling her in close.)
Mike: I saved you.
(She roughly pulls her arm away.)
Woman: You exposed me!
(She sighs and walks around him to look out the door.)
Woman: You exposed the program.
(She turns to face him again.)
Woman: The people who gave me this technology, they are very serious and they do not want to be revealed. Mike Peterson, needs to disappear.
Mike: You’re right. I’m not him anymore.
(He walks to stand closer to her.)
Mike: I’m someone else now.
Woman: Oh, please. You’re juiced, Mike.
(He walks away from her and she follows.)
Woman: And you’re losing it, just like the last guy. This is a disaster.
(Mike has walked to the open window and stands there, then turns to look at her.)
Mike: No. It’s an origin story.
(With that, he jumps.)
(Cut to the alleyway where Skye’s van sits. We cut to inside and Skye is flipping switches while she talks on her cell phone.)
Skye: Audio file should be coming though. It’s not compressed so it might take a minute.
(Cut to Fitz still inside The Bus and on his cell phone. We hear a beeping sounds from off to his side.)
Fitz: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I’m getting it.
(Fitz runs over to one of the computer terminal and punches some buttons.)
Fitz: So, uh, when – when you get back, I’ll show you my thing.
(He immediately regrets his choice of words and stammers to correct himself.)
Fitz: A thing, it’s not…it’s my hardware.
(That sounds worse.)
Fitz: My equipment.
(Not any better Fitz.)
Fitz: Let’s…hang up.
(He takes the ear piece out throwing it down.)
(Skye takes the phone away from her ear, gives it a confused look and ends the call.)
(Cut back inside The Bus. Fitz walks by the camera to reveal Coulson and Simmons talking. She has on her lab coat and Coulson stands behind her. Simmons has a drill in her hand and is using it on the piece of metal they found in the explosion.)
Coulson:So the alien metal wasn’t the explosive?
Simmons: Well, I assumed from the break pattern and dispersion that it was, but, it’s just dripping with gamma radiation –
(Something literally drips out of the metal, a thick yellow substance and Simmons exclaims in surprise.)
Simmons: Oh! Now it’s actually dripping.
(She laughs and looks at Coulson for a moment before going back to work.)
Simmons: Fun!
(A very angry looking Ward enters the room to confront Coulson, he is now in a T-shirt and jeans as opposed to the suit he was wearing.)
Ward: So, what did that get us?
(Fitz walks in front of Ward and speaks, even though Ward wasn’t talking to him.)
Fitz: Skye’s sending us the rest of her decrypted files on centipede. But we have her audio. I’ve loaded it up.
(Ward hadn’t taken his eyes off Coulson until Fitz says it’s loaded, he follows after him.)
Coulson: Nice work.
(Ward tenses and turns to look at Coulson, obviously still extremely upset about getting drugged against his knowledge, Coulson smirks at him. Fitz remains oblivious as to the tension.)
Fitz: Now, using motion estimation, Bayesian Inference, a beam splitter and a little defraction theory, our mystery man…appears.
(While he was talking he has taken some sort of device into his hands. He walks to the metal staircase going up a few steps then turns the device into the empty portion of the room. He flips something and a grainy looking hologram appears before them all. We now see the same image, of the angry man talking to the other man, but it’s in 3D as opposed to 1D.)
Fitz: It’s like magic. But it’s – it’s science.
(He says this in a way that’s meant to calm the guys, as if it could have been magic for all they knew.)
(Ward has stepped closer to the hologram looking it over.)
Ward: Explosives in the case?
(The hologram starts to move when synced with the audio.)
Hologram Science Man: …please clam down. Just let me check your vitals.
Angry Man: I feel fine. I want to feel more. Where’s the doctor? Where is she?
(He is getting more and more agitated as he speaks as the Science Man tries to calm him.)
Science Man: I-If you don’t settle down I’ll have you sedated.
(Angry Man has picked up a chair and slams it down with his next question.)
Angry Man: Where is she?
(The hologram stops.)
Fitz: Wait, did you – did you see that on his arm?
(Fitz rewinds to the part where Angry Man is lifting the chair up high, Ward steps in closer to look at the man’s arm.)
Coulson: What does that look like to you?
(Fitz freezes the playback as we get a good look at the tech on the man’s arm. It is identical to the one Mike has.)
Ward: A centipede.
(Simmons gets excited and walks over.)
Simmons: It’s an intravenous filter for his blood. This goo, sir – very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine developed in the 40s for the –
(This gets Coulson’s immediate attention.)
Coulson: Super soldiers.
Simmons: I’m reading alien metal, gamma radiation, the serum, every known source of super power thrown in a blender.
(Coulson quickly turns to Fitz.)
Coulson: We need to see the origin of the blast. Run it back from the last point recorded.
(We cut to May and Skye still inside her van. While May isn’t looking she moves a pad of paper aside, hiding under it are three microchips. She plucks up one and sticks it in her bra.)
Skye: That should do it.
(She closes her laptop as May leans in the door.)
May: Let’s head back.
(May falls forward into Skye’s van when she is hit by someone from behind. They grab her by her throat and throw her out of the van causing her to hit the wall hard and fall down unconscious. We now see that it’s none other than Mike.)
Skye: Mike. What are you doing?
Mike: Saving you. From the scary men in dark suits. And you’re going to help save us.
Skye: “Us”?
(Mike reaches off to the side where we, and Skye, cannot see. He pulls Ace into view by his arm, the little boy looks scared.)
Mike: Don’t cry, okay? Stay strong for me, Ace.
(Mike lifts Ace into the van getting in behind him. Skye scrambles closer to the wheel getting some distance. Mike sits Ace on his lap.)
Mike: What are we?
Ace: We’re a team.
Mike: That’s right.
(He looks at Skye while he closes the door.)
Mike: Now drive.
Coulson: Extremis. It’s new. Completely unstable.
Simmons: Poor man didn’t bring an explosive. And Mike has the same stuff in his system.
Ward: And judging by his strength level, a lot more.
Fitz: So, any minute now Mike is gonna –
Simmons: He’ll take out anyone within a two block radius.
(Coulson walks over to the doorway stopping beside Ward.)
Coulson: Well, you wanted a bomb.
Simmons: Sir? He didn’t explode because he was angry. The two are connected, it’s – it’s kind of a chemical surge. But, calming him down will buy him a minute at most. He will detonate within the next few hours.
Coulson: Solution?
Simmons: Isolate him, get him away from people?
Coulson: Or?
Fitz: Put a bullet though his brain.
Simmons: If he’s dead this irradiated metabolic process will stop.
Coulson: We need to come up with a third option. One that doesn’t involve Mike’s son losing a father.
Simmons: We have a couple of hours, at most. There’s no way that we could possibly –
Coulson: Don’t ever tell me there’s no way! It’s on you. Get it done. May?
May: He took Skye.
Coulson: You all right?
May: We’ll deal with that later, at length. Right now we need to figure out where they went.
Mike: How long’s this going to take?
Skye: This is top speed, trust me. It’s not like I’m deleting a Facebook page. I’m bypassing the license bureau’s A.E.S. protected data stream. So, chill.
Mike: How do I know you can really do this?
Skye: I’ve done it before.
Fitz: Come on, give me more paralysis. Less rigor mortis! Oh, come on! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Simmons: Just, pretend it’s an exam.That doesn’t seem to help Fitz, he tenses in frustration then shakes it off. We’re taking an exam.
Fitz: An exam – yeah.
Simmons: Yeah.
Fitz: Okay. I don’t want an “F”. “F” equals a massacre. Whoa.
Simmons: Oh no! What is this nonsense? Why are you making nonsense?!?
Fitz: This isn’t me! It’s noise! Someone’s hacking our secure channel.
Coulson: It’s longitude and latitude. Mike took Skye. She’s telling us where.
Mike: We’ll take the nice lady with us. We, we can’t go to the airport, so we’ll – we’ll take a train. And there she’ll – she’ll help us start over, make a new life – a better life, like I always said.
Ward: Look at this place. You’re going to risk thousands of lives over some nobody?
Coulson: Nobody’s nobody, Ward. Fitz-Simmons will come through. Mr. Peterson, good morning. We’re not a threat. We’re here to help. But you’re in danger and we need to take you in.
Mike: What did you do?!?
(In the train sataion)
Skye: You’re right, he is a little bitch.
Mike: Ace, get back! Ace!
Coulson: Let’s get him out of here.
Ace: I want my daddy.
Coulson: I promise.
Mike: Ace! Ace!
Ward: Look, the stuff inside you is unstable It’ll kill you and everyone else in here.
Mike: Who’s gonna miss us?
Coulson: We’re at the north entrance, May.
Ward: You told them to hold fire.
Coulson: I don’t think that’s us. We may have a third party here. He’s gonna head down to the tracks.
(Coulson is speaking to Ward.)
Coulson: You stay high, I’ll go low. Only take the shot if you have to, Ward. Ward!
Ward: If I have to.
(Cut to outside, Mike still has Skye by her arm leading her.)
Skye: You’ve got to stop! These people can help you.
Mike: The men in suits? They’re your buddies now? Where did they take my son?!?
(Gun shots)
Mike: Get down!
(Mike fights a guy and then May fights a guy)
Mike: Think that means anything? I know you got men everywhere waiting to put me down. I know how this plays out.
Coulson: I don’t. I know you got poison in your system. I know it’s burning you up. Mike, the last guy who wore that exploded.
Mike: I’m not like that other guy. I’m – It matters who I am, inside, if I’m a good person, if I’m strong.
Ward (on coms): I have a clear shot. Do you copy?
Coulson: I know you’re strong. Your boy knows it. He needs you to let us help.
Mike: You took him! You took my wife, my job, my house. You think this is killing me?!? All over, there’s people being pushed down, being robbed. One of them tries to stand up, you got to make an example out of him.
Coulson: You bring this building down on us, will that help them?
Mike: That’s a lie! All you do is lie! You said if we worked hard… if we did right… we’d have a place. You said it was enough to be a man. But there’s better than man. There’s Gods. And the rest of us, what are we? They’re giants, we’re what they step on.
Coulson: I know. I’ve seen giants – up close. And that privilege cost me, nearly everything. But the good ones, the real deal, they’re not heroes because of what they have that we don’t. It’s what they do with it. You’re right, Mike. It matters who you are.
Mike: I could, you know? Be a hero.
Coulson: I’m counting on it.
(We hear a silenced gunshot and Mike falls back hard.)
(Cut to Hill in headquarters, she is standing at a bank of monitors as we hear Coulson’s report via radio.)
Coulson: Subject is in stable condition. All clear at Union Station.
(Cut to a farmhouse. We can see Coulson and Skye there.)
Skye: I told him his father was coming home.
Coulson: He will. We have some experience with this.
Skye: He almost blew. We almost died.
Coulson: We have some experience with that, too.
Skye: Don’t have it all mapped out.
Coulson: True. We didn’t cut off the head of the centipede. Whoever sponsored that little experiment is still out there, among other things.
Skye: It’s a brave new world, and a really old car.
Coulson: Lola can keep up. What about you? Have you thought about the offer?
Skye: Hitching a ride on the crazy plane? I’m not exactly a team player.
Coulson: We’re not exactly a team. But we’re in a position to do some good. You’d be a great help. And you’d be front row center at the strangest show on Earth, which is, after all, what you wanted.
Skye: I was able to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. from my van. You’re gonna show me something new?
Coulson: Go.
Ward (on the phone): Sir, we’ve got an 0-8-4.
Coulson: Is that confirmed?
Ward: They want us to go in and confirm it.
Skye: What’s an 0-8-4?
Coulson: You’ve got exactly ten minutes to decide if you really want to know.
Skye: There’s no way we can make it to the airfield in –
(Coulson reaches down, flips a switch and Lola starts to fly)
Skye: …ten minutes.
Coulson: The tide is rising.
