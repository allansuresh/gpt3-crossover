[Open on vertical cellphone video of Superman interacting with officers, firefighters, and paramedics just after performing a heroic deed.]

Podcast Kid 2: There he is!

Podcast Kid 1: Shh! Shh! C'mon, let's go!

[They run over to him.]

Podcast Kid 1: Superman! Superman! Can we ask you some questions?

Podcast Kid 2: It's for our podcast.

Superman: Well, in that case...

Podcast Kid 1: How many people that you saved- have you saved?

Superman: I...

Podcast Kid 1: Never mind. Does your thing really stand for "hope"?

Superman: Yes. It does.

Podcast Kid 2: But it looks like an "S".

Superman: Yes, it's meant to. It's meant to wind, like a river. It comes and goes. My fa... A man I knew, used to say that hope is like your car keys. Easy to lose, but if you dig around... it's usually close by.

Podcast Kid 2: Did you ev- ever fight a hippo?

Podcast Kid 1: That's dumb!

Podcast Kid 2: But hippos are the most deadly!

Podcast Kid 1: Um... What is, uh... What's the best thing about Planet Earth?

[Superman ponders the question, then smiles as he's about to answer the question when the podcast abruptly ends.]

What are you doing? Wait! No, wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Please, man! Please! What do you want from me? Fear. They could smell it. What the hell? - What was that? - A scout. From space? Like an alien army? Alfred, are you seeing this? I am. Matches the other sightings. And that pattern is all over Luthor's notes. Prep the jet. I'm going north tonight. Good. It's time, then. It's 'cause they know he's dead, right? Superman. He's gone. Where does that leave us? Drop your guns now! Excuse me? - Move it. Move! - Don't shoot! Get down. Line them up along the wall. Keep them quiet. Who are you? The lasso of Hestia compels you to reveal the truth. Now, who are you? We're a small group of reactionary terrorists. We know that sinners brought - on this plague of... - Why the hostages? You're too late. The countdown's already begun. In a few minutes, 4 city blocks... While the world watches. Shut up! This is man's best hope. Down with the modern world. Back to the Dark Ages. And the safety of holy fear. This would've been over quickly, but... No! Don't! I don't believe it. - What are you? - A believer.

Bruce Wayne: I'm asking for your help. I believe there's a stranger, comes to this village from the sea. He comes in the winter when the people are hungry and brings fish. He comes on the king tide... That was last night.

[A local speaks in a foreign language. Arthur Curry translates.]

Arthur Curry: Icebergs in the harbour. Four months since the last ship got through.

Bruce Wayne: Well, this stranger... Doesn't come by ship. There are enemies coming, from far away. I need warriors. I'm building an alliance, to defend ourselves. Look, I'll give you $25,000 to talk to this man right now, outside.

Arthur Curry: [In foreign language] Pretty sure he'll give it to me anyway.

[The crowd laughs. Bruce glances around, clearly unpleased that things aren't going his way. He then notices a sketch of the three Motherboxes, Steppenwolf included, drawn on the wall.]

Bruce Wayne: Tell me what those 3 boxes are and I'll make it 30.

[Arthur steps up to Bruce menacingly.]

Arthur Curry: You should get out.

Bruce Wayne: Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

[Arthur grabs Bruce by the lapels of his jacket and slams him into the wall.]

Bruce Wayne: Arthur Curry. Also known as the Protector of the Oceans. The Aquaman. I hear you can talk to fish.

[Cut to Bruce and Arthur walking alongside each other outside.]

Arthur: So let me get this straight... You do it dressed like a bat? Like an- Like an actual bat?

Bruce: It's worked for 20 years in Gotham.

Arthur: Oh, that shithole.

Bruce: When the fight comes, we'll need you.

Arthur: Don't count on it, Batman.

Bruce: Why not?

Arthur: Because I don't like you coming here, digging into my business, getting into my life. People from Atlantis tell me, "Do this." Now, you say, "Do that." I want to be left alone.

Bruce: That why you help these people out here in the middle of nowhere? Because you can just leave?

Arthur: I help them 'cause no one else does.

Bruce: You wanna protect them, you need to work with me.

Arthur: A strong man is strongest alone. You ever heard that?

[Arthur takes off his shirt and casts it aside.]

Bruce: That's not a saying. That's the opposite of what the saying is.

Arthur: Yep. Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

Bruce: You ever heard of Superman? He died fighting next to me.

Arthur: My point exactly.

[He wades into the waters.]

Bruce: What's in the 3 boxes?

Arthur: It's ancient history!

Bruce: What is it? Mankind's melting the polar ice caps? Destroying the ecosystem? They got it coming?

Arthur: Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise!

Bruce: How about if they boil?

Arthur: Dressed like a bat... You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne!

[Arthur dives back into the water, swimming away.]

Bruce: Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

[Cut to Bruce's private jet, where he's just finished shaving. Alfred walks up, a pot of tea and two miniature mugs in hand. He hands one to Bruce.]

Alfred: So, you say you have no way of reconnecting with this... Aquaman.

Bruce Wayne: I put a tracking device in his coat. He left without it. It may, in fact, not have been his coat. Those squares, from Luthor's notes... I think they must be containers of some kind.

Alfred: Of what?

Bruce Wayne: I don't know. Money, power. Something worth starting a war over.

Alfred: Well, we had luck with one person on the team list...

[Alfred presses a touch screen on the table and a wall of screens drops down from the opposite wall.]

Alfred: Barry Allen, of Central City. He's completely off the grid. Squatting, I think. Moves suddenly and often.

Bruce Wayne: Disappearing act?

Alfred: But he does visit his father. In prison. For murdering his mother.

Bruce Wayne: Jesus!

Alfred: Young Barry always protested his father's innocence. But he was nine and nobody listened to him.

Bruce Wayne: We have somebody at the prison?

Alfred: Oh, yeah. We'll find the address.

[Bruce sets his mug down.]

Bruce: What about, uh... Diana?

Alfred: Well, you have her number.

Bruce Wayne: You could've called her.

Alfred: Oh, perhaps I should fly to Paris with a handwritten note? "Will you be Bruce's teammate? Check: Yes or No".

Bruce Wayne: I'm only interested in her skill set.

Alfred: Oh, I'm sure you are.

Bruce: Can we?

Alfred: Ah, well, facial recognition's a bit dodgy on this one. But it's got a partial match. A Victor Stone. Genius I.Q., football scholarship to GCU... And deceased.

Bruce Wayne: Figures. Fairy tales and ghost stories.

Alfred: One misses the days when one's biggest concerns were exploding wind-up penguins.

Bruce Wayne: The simple life.

[Bruce sits across from Alfred.]

Alfred: I don't recognize this world.

Bruce Wayne: I don't have to recognize it. I just have to save it.

Here to see Henry Allen. Sign.

Hurry it up, will you?

What, you got a problem?

No, there's no problem.

Better not be.

You know where to go.

Are those prescription... Or you just trying to look brainy?

Because you're holding yourself back. You're going in circles. You're working 3 dead-end jobs. Going on four. Where do you even have the time?

I make the time.

And this is all to pay for a criminal justice degree, huh?

Okay. I really don't want to talk about this again...

The investigation was botched.

Give me your hand. I want you to listen to me, Barry... Because I mean this. I want you to give all of that up. And I want you to stop coming to see me. I am a drag on your life.

Please don't ever say that to me again. Please?

You can be whatever you wanna be. You're a brilliant man. Absolute best of the best. I can't sit here and watch you run in place in Central City for some old dude who's not going anywhere.

Dad... That's not true.

It's time.

That's not true.

Let's go, Allen. Allen!

I want you to make your own future. Living in the past... Make your own future.

Open gate! Lab's all yours, Howard. 11:30. Early night for you, Silas. Yes. Early. I never got to say... I'm very sorry about what happened. Victor was a wonderful kid. Thank you. Victor. Victor, you're not stuck up here. You can have a life. You can have more than... - If you stay up here brooding... - I'm processing. I can access everything. - But I can't put it all together. - Not yet. But if you work with me, if we had the change engines... So you did to someone else. What you did to me. No. The box stays hidden. If you could see what we're learning from the Kryptonian ship... I think the change engine can integrate with its energy... - get it powered up...

Does anybody know?

What?

At the lab... Does anybody know I'm alive?

I... I... I didn't think you were ready for them to...

For what? For them to see the monster?

You are not a monster.

It's weird that you thought I meant me.

What I did... I lost your mother in that accident. I wasn't about to... I couldn't bear to lose my son.

But you did. I got a language in my head that I don't speak. It's not just digital... It's alien. Everyday, I wake up, different... Modified.

How do you...?

Couldn't do that last night. Ever since we got visitors from Krypton, people have been waiting for the next alien invasion. Now I got to wonder if I'm it?

Any changes today? - No, my Queen. The Mother Box has awoken... Yet, nothing has happened. It has slept for thousands of years, since the first age. Why did it wake at all? Amazons, on your mark! Steppenwolf. Mother... Millenia in exile... Searching. At last, you call me home. You will not like your welcome. Oh, I think I will. - Gather the legions. - Seal the cage! Go! Flank right! Yes... Run. Seal the gates! Keep it moving. Got it! Go! Noble Queen, why do you fight? After the Unity, you will join my Legion... and you will know the righteousness of power. You will love me. You all will. We have to light the ancient warning fire. The fire has not burned for 5,000 years. Men won't know what it means. Men won't... But she will. Listen to me, Diana. What did you do this weekend, Diana? Me? Nothing very interesting. That's all you ever tell us. Whay can I say? I'm not that exciting. ...Shrine of the Amazons... an enormous bonfire burned right behind me... baffling absolutely everyone... from locals, to government authorities alike. - The fire could be seen for miles on end... - Invasion. On the local scene... This janitor's wife had some strong words... for the aliens she says, stole her man. My Howard is a good man. He's a provider. And these aliens are gonna (beep) probe him? Come down to the Lakeview... And I'll stick a (beep) probe up your alien (beep) ass, you... I found a little place. By the diner. Suits me just fine. I wish you'd said something. Oh, no. I got behind in the payments. And you know the banks. Jump like a cougar if you miss by a dime. Place was too big for me anyway. Shuffling around like an old ghost. Well, I might have been able to, talk to someone, or... You had enough to deal with. Don't need to add mother-in-law to the list. - Not that I was ever... - Hey, Lane... Who is your source? The activist in that university... Look, it's my source. I got tapped for the kidnapping story. There were all those student protests. Anyway... I'm thinking it's political, so... Who's your guy? Well let's see if she'll take your call. So, it's a she. It's not a she. Sounds like you should be working that story. I'm... I'm not ready yet. I'm perfectly happy, doing fluff pieces about kitten grooming. For a while... It was hard coming back here at all. Well. I can hardly read the news anyway. So much bitterness. 'Course, I think it's all because he's gone. But I suppose a mother does. But it's not like there's any less that needs reporting. And Clark promised me, you were gonna bring home another Pulitzer. - Oh, did he? - Oh, yes. He did. He said you were the thirstiest young woman he'd ever met. - Hungriest. - Hungry. Yeah. He said you... could smell a story. Further away than he could hear. Well stories, made sense. It was more than just a puzzle. It was about the truth. It was about seeing the engine of the world... While it still ran. Victor Stone... Deceased. That one... Pretty sure that's what made the alien go crazy. I'll see about weaving something to the suit. Won't be quick. Anything to give me an edge. You know, I paid millions of dollars... for this building's security. Yeah. It looked expensive. Hi. A new toy? Prototype troop carrier. I once knew a man who would've loved to fly it. Yeah, well we're gonna need more than a pilot. I think there's an attack coming. Not coming, Bruce. It's already here. They called him Steppenwolf. The End of Worlds. He lived only to conquer. Millions fell before his blade... And rose again as his Parademons. Nightmare creatures, who feed on fear. Yeah, I think I've met one. We didn't hit it off. Here in Gotham? They're all over. They're looking for his... Boxes? - The Mother Boxes. - Mother Boxes? I guess Steppenwolf sent the winged people that leaves two more. - I'm impressed. - Don't be. I have no idea what's in them. A weapon? Some kind of power? They don't contain power. They are power. Carried from planet to planet... The Mother Boxes combined to form the Unity. An apocalyptic power that not only destroys worlds... ...but transforms them into the primordial hell's gate... ...of Steppenwolf's birthworld. We should have died... But we formed our own Unity. Amazons, Atlanteans... All the tribes of man fought side by side. Warriors of legend. Allies from other worlds. Even the gods themselves all acted as one. Laying down their lives to drive Steppenwolf away. Some say it drove him mad... .. the disgrace of his first retreat. He swore our alliance would crumble. That darkness would cover the Earth... And that he would return when it did. Left behind... The Mother Boxes were too dangerous to be kept together. One was entrusted to the Amazons. One, to the Atlanteans. Both sealed and guarded in secure strongholds. The Box of Man was buried in secret. So that no tribe would be tempted to use its power over another. Such harmony out of such horror. It was truly an age of heroes. Something tells me we're not getting the band back together. The Atlanteans were a force under sea... And the Amazons, to an island they can never leave. I wouldn't count on the tribes of men. We tend to act like the doomsday clock has a snooze button. - How long until we... - Days. At most. Steppenwolf's mistake last time was attacking us. He wanted to make the Earth kneel before he destroyed us. This time he'll just go after the Boxes. I got a location for one of our recruits. - Barry Allen. - What about the other one? Victor Stone? I was hoping you would dig him up.

Diana Prince: We're asking people we don't know to risk their lives.

Bruce Wayne: I know. That's how this works.

Bruce Wayne: Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

Barry Allen: You say that like it explains why there's a total stranger in my place... sitting in the dark, in my second favorite chair.

Bruce Wayne: Tell me about this.

Barry Allen: This is a person who looks exactly like me... but who is definitely not me. Very attractive Jewish boy. Somebody who, I don't know, stole your pocket watch? Or railroads?

Bruce Wayne: I know you have abilities. I just don't know what they are.

Barry Allen: My special skills include viola, web design, fluent in sign language -- gorilla sign language...

Bruce Wayne: Silica-based quartz sand fabric. Abrasion-resistant. Heat resistant.

Barry Allen: Yeah, I do... competitive ice dancing.

Bruce Wayne: That's what they use on the space shuttles, to prevent it from burning up on re-entry.

Barry Allen: I do very competitive ice dancing. Whoever you're looking for, it's not me.

[Bruce whips around and throws a Batarang at Barry, who smoothly enters the Speed Force and sidesteps it. His eyes become fixed on the Batarang as it slowly flies past him, and he turns to Bruce, connecting the dots. He turns back to the Batarang, catching it in midair.]

Barry Allen: You're the Batman?

Bruce Wayne: So, you're fast.

Barry Allen: That feels like an oversimplification...

Bruce Wayne: I'm putting together a team. People with special abilities. You see, I believe enemies are coming-

Barry Allen: Stop right there! I'm in!

Bruce Wayne: You are?

Barry Allen: Yeah. I need... friends. People are difficult. They require a lot of focus. They have, like, a rhythm that I haven't quite been able to... Like, Brunch? Like... What is Brunch? You wait in line for an hour... for, essentially, lunch. I mean, I don't know. People are... a little slow.

Bruce Wayne: I'll try to keep up.

Barry Allen: Can I keep this?

Barry Allen: It's like this layer of dimensional reality that seems to manipulate space-time. I call it the Speed Force. Causes me to burn a tremendous amount of calories... So I am just a black hole of snacks. I am a "snack hole." How many people are on this special fight team?

Bruce Wayne: Three. Including you.

Barry Allen: Three? Against what?

Bruce Wayne: I'll tell you on the plane.

Barry Allen: Plane? What are your superpowers again?

Bruce Wayne: I'm rich.

The program always gets twitchy with this footage.

Victor Stone: Why are you and Bruce Wayne looking for me?

You know who we are?

Victor Stone: And I also know where you are.

Are you Victor Stone?

Victor Stone: Was.

I need to speak to you.

Victor Stone: You are.

No, face to face. I'm old-fashioned that way.

Victor Stone: Why would I trust you?

If I was going to attack you, I would've done it by the lake.

Alfred: Looks like you have a date, Ms. Prince. About time somebody here did.

Face to face. I've been doing some tracking. What you're looking for is sticking to the dead zones. It gets in front of a camera, causes a surge. - I'll let you know. - That's not good enough. Not good enough? For you. Look, I don't know you... And I don't know how you got these gifts. Gifts? No one else can do what you do. No, if these are gifts... then why am I the one paying for them? We need you, Victor. And maybe you need us. I'll be fine alone. I told myself the same for a long time. I lost someone I loved once. I shut myself off from... From everyone. But I had to learn to open back up again. The truth is I'm still working on it. And if you agreed to meet me... ...you're working on it, too. Trust me, Victor. Mayday! Mayday! Something came down from the sky. Please, help me! Whisky. And one for Ahab there. ...from the sky... I heard a cannon. - It's ocean's rage. - Then they came... Monsters. ...from the sky. Tore right through my boat. Monsters... It's on him. You took a hell of a hit. You all right? At last... The firstborn of beloved Queen Atlanna. Wait. Please. I knew her. That makes one of us. When my parents fought in the wars... - She took me in. - What a saint. You dare speak of Queen Atlanna that way? Your Queen left me on my father's doorstep and never gave me another thought... Your mother left you to save your life. You can't imagine how it hurt her. What it cost her. But you're not a defenseless child now. It would've been her responsibility... to follow that monster to the surface and stop it. Now, it's yours. Then I'm gonna need something from you. Leave that. Leave it. It will never work. I see, Mother. I see why you waited to summon me. That Kryptonian's death plunged this timid world... into such terror. Amazons. Atlanteans. Each stands, and falls, alone. I know Mother. You've waited too long for the Unity. I know. But you will feed. And my exile will come to an end. I will take my place among the New Gods. Find the last one. Its power will cleanse this world. For the Unity! For Darkseid. Victor. Asshole! Eight kidnappings. 6 in Metropolis, 2 here. All the vics worked for STAR Labs. Attacked by a flying vampire. Suspect was a giant bat... with huge fangs. One of them was a little kid, scared. Won't say a word but drew this. - Looks like... - I know what it looks like. Come on. You think he fights criminals for 20 years here... and then he goes to Metropolis and kidnaps eight people? I'll talk to him tonight. The world's gone crazy, Jim. Maybe he did, too. You find the Cyborg? We spoke. Give him time. You must be Barry. I'm Diana. Hi Barry, I'm Diana... That's not right. Great. So this is us? Yeah. This is us. Oh! Awesome! That's the Bat-signal. That's your... Oh. Sorry. That's your signal. That means we have to go now. - Yeah. That's what that means. - That's so cool. How many of you are there? Not enough. Eight people abducted from or near STAR Labs. Here's the potential perp. Parademons. Okay... The demons must have caught the scent of a Mother Box. They carried people away to find out what they know. - So the eight might still be alive. - Nine. The head of STAR Labs was taken as well. You made it. So then. There must be a nest nearby. I plotted all the sightings in Metropolis, Gotham... No pattern I can see. The lines on the map don't converge. On land. These lead back to Braxton Island, between the two cities. Gotham Harbor. These are air vents... they all lead down to the tunnel from Metropolis... project that was abandoned in '29. Do you really think that... Wow. They just... They really just vanished. That's rude. - Where are we, Alfred? - Braxton Island. You should be... directly under the venting tower for the tunnel. Now, look to your left, you should see a staircase. It will give you access to the machine room. Define access. One at a time. The bridge may not... ...hold.

[The League heads on over to the bridge to find Steppenwolf interrogating several captured scientists, including Silas Stone. Steppenwolf lifts up a female scientist and interrogates her about the last Mother Box]

Steppenwolf: Just tell me the truth.

Scientist: Please, just let us go. I have a family!

Steppenwolf: Wrong answer.

[Steppenwolf crushes the scientists neck and kills her, dropping her lifeless body next to the other scientists, who are visibly terrified]

Steppenwolf: Humans... The stench of your fear is making my soldiers hungry. Shall I feed them?

[Steppenwolf then grabs a male scientist to interrogate next]

Steppenwolf: You've been near the Mother Box. The scent is on you...

Scientist Please. We have families.

Steppenwolf: Why does everyone keep telling me that?

The Flash: Right. Okay, yeah, here's the thing, um... See, I'm afraid of bugs, and, um, guns. And obnoxiously tall people, and murder, and I can't be here.

[A Parademon screeches from offscreen.]

The Flash: It's really cool you guys seem ready to do battle and stuff, but... Full transparency, I've never done battle. I've just pushed some people and run away.

Batman: Save one.

The Flash: One?

Batman: Save one person.

The Flash: Uh... Wait, which one?

Batman: Don't talk. Don't fight. Get in. Get one out.

The Flash: And- And then?

Batman: You'll know.

The Flash: Okay.

Steppenwolf: Useless! You then.

[As Cyborg goes in for a closer look, Steppenwolf picks up Silas to interrogate him next]

Cyborg: Where is my Mother Box?

Silas Stone: I'll die before I tell you!

Steppenwolf: At last, one that doesn't whine. But you will scream.

[Upon seeing his father being threatened by Steppenwolf, Cyborg shoots the villain and grabs his father out of Steppenwolf's grasp]

Cyborg: Dad!

Silas Stone: Victor!

[A parademon attempts to shoot Cyborg, but Steppenwolf regonizes the Mother Boxs' influence on Cyborg and stops him]

Steppenwolf: You were born of her. A creature of chaos!

Cyborg: Not how I see it.

Steppenwolf: Give it time.

[Cyborg shoots Steppenwolf in the shoulder just as Wonder Woman leaps down and kills one of the parademons. Steppenwolf rushes for his axe, but Wonder Woman tackles him through a wall. He recovers and realizes who she is]

Steppenwolf: Amazon!

The Flash: Okay. Save one.

[While Flash goes to save a scientist, Steppenwolf confronts Wonder Woman]

Steppenwolf: This one is mine.

[The Parademons back off, allowing Steppenwolf the chance to fight the Amazon alone]

Wonder Woman: You overestimate yourself.

Steppenwolf: Child... My axe is still slick with the blood of your sisters.

[Steppenwolf and Wonder Woman engage in a heated duel. Meanwhile, Batman attempts to take on the Parademons, but one Parademon easily overwhelms and tosses the masked vigilante around]

Batman: Alfred, I need the Kightcrawler!

Alfred: I thought you'd never ask. Crawler's on the way. Initiating remote mode!

[Meanwhile, Flash and Cyborg evacuate Silas and the scientists, with Silas being the last one escorted out by his sob]

Cyborg: You good? At the end of the hall there should be stairs.

Silas Stone: Okay.

Cyborg: Go!

Silas Stone: He's after the change engine. His Mother Box. You have to keep him from it.

Cyborg: Help people get to safety!

Silas Stone: Promise me.

Cyborg: Go!

[Steppenwolf quickly grows bored with his duel with Wonder Woman and signals the Parademons]

Steppenwolf: Finish her!

[The Knightcrawler arrives and Batman enters it, intervening to help Wonder Woman]

Batman: Sorry guys, I didn't bring a sword.

[Batman opens fire on the Parademons, killing two, before Steppenwolf jumps onto and attacks the Knightcrawler]

Batman: Jesus. He is tall.

[Flash helps Wonder Woman reach her sword, at which point Steppenwolf reshifts his focus upon her again]

Steppenwolf: So... You have the blood of the Old Gods in you. The Old Gods died.

[Wonder Woman uses her guanlets to push Steppenwolf away. Meanwhile, the Parademons wound Flash and attempt to carry him away]

The Flash: No!

[Wonder Woman quickly leaps up and kills the parademons, saving Flash. While Batman and Cyborg head down to join them against Steppenwolf]

Cyborg: Heads up! [Takes control of the Knightcrawler] Thanks, Alfred. But I'll take it from here.

Alfred: Uh, do I know you?

[Cyborg opens fire at Steppenwolf with missiles, but Steppenwolf grabs the missile and gazes upon it, unimpressed]

Steppenwolf: Primitive beings.

[Steppenwolf points the missile towards the wall, where it explodes, creating a huge hole and causing water to come out of it]

The Flash: What are we under right now?

Batman: Gotham Harbor.

You all need to move. - You get him out... - Diana, there's no time. Also among my fears is drowning. You are a distraction. Mother is calling. Diana, come on! Come on. The change engine. Did he just bail? Millions in structural damage. You haven't lost your touch. But it's good to see you playing well with others.

Aquaman: Dressed like a bat. I dig it.

Batman: [Through gritted teeth] May be temporary.

So... What made you change your mind? Steppenwolf. He took the Mother Box from Atlantis. All he needs now is the last box of man. If he doesn't already have it. He doesn't have it. We need to get away. No. We are safer here. What happens when we run out of food? Someone will come. Who will come for us? Wow. It's like a cave. Like a Batcave. Barry! My father called it the change engine. It was found by the British during World War I. They studied it... but they couldn't even date it. It's so old. It was shelved, until the night Superman died. Then she lit up like Christmas. They brought it to STAR Labs... where my father recognized it... as a perpetual energy matrix. That sounds cool. I thought it was like a nuclear bomb. A Mother Box destroys as it creates. It's a cycle of life, but a million times faster. My father thought it was the key to unlimited energy. New formulas, cellular regeneration... But it's too volatile to control. He used it on you. I was in an accident. I should've died. My father thought that he could use the Mother Box to rebuild the broken parts of me with a few cybernetic enhancements. Instead, he built a living machine. I may be stronger than its host. Too much. Too much life. What's on your weird mind? Muscles. Coordination. Basic cellular integrity. A human being can only absorb so much. The Mother Box was designed to reshape a planet. So?

So... What if you were stronger than a planet? Your cells lying dormant, but incapable of decay. If you were in a conductive field, a boost from the Mother Box... could bring him back to life. The Kryptonian ship has an amniotic chamber, which would be a perfect...

Diana Prince: No.

Bruce Wayne: Diana!

Diana Prince: Bruce, no! You have no idea what kind of power you're dealing with.

Bruce Wayne: Even if there was a fraction of a chance--

Diana Prince: That what? That we could raise a monster? Like Luthor did?

Bruce Wayne: We have tech Luthor's never even seen...

Diana Prince: Superman is dead. We all wish he weren't.

Bruce Wayne: We don't know what state he's in. We know we can't bring him back. But this is science beyond our limits! And that's what science is for, to do what's never been done. To make life better.

Diana Prince: Or to end it. Technology is like any other power... Without reason, without heart... It destroys us. You're risking lives. Theirs and maybe countless more.

Bruce Wayne: We don't have time for a control group. Is it a risk? Yes. But it's necessary.

Diana Prince: Why? Because of your guilt? Bruce, I was there. You didn't kill Superman. At some point, even you... have to learn to move on.

Bruce Wayne: Did Steve Trevor tell you that?

[Diana pushes Bruce against a pile of boxes with her super strength.]

Bruce Wayne: Superman, was a beacon to the world. Why aren't you? You're an inspiration, Diana. You don't just save people. You make them see their better selves. And yet, I never heard of you... Until Luthor lured you out by stealing a picture of your dead boyfriend. You shut yourself down for a century. So let's not talk about me moving on.

Barry Allen: You know that if she kills you, we'll cover for her?

Bruce Wayne: We are not enough! Each of us in our own way has held back. And I promise you, Steppenwolf is not out there talking about ethics. He's trying to burn down the world. The way we're gonna stop him is by using his power -- this power -- against him.

Victor Stone: I agree. Don't like the idea of reintegrating with the Mother Box... But I was running the numbers while you were being an asshole, and there's a high probability that we can bring him back.

Barry Allen: Right, but we mean bring him back, in like a... "Yay! He's back!" way. Not in like a... Like a Pet Sematary scenario?

Arthur Curry: You lose something when you die. Even Superman. Maybe not his mind. Maybe his soul.

Bruce Wayne: I'll have a contingency plan for that.

Diana Prince: If he wakes up and you're the first thing he sees... You'll need one.

Alfred Pennyworth: Well that was fun while it didn't last.

Bruce Wayne: She could've stopped me. I practically dared her to.

Alfred Pennyworth: I don't see why you're pushing her.

Bruce Wayne: We'll have to boost the signal. Put it through the Batmobile's speakers.

Alfred Pennyworth: Now you're changing the subject.

Bruce Wayne: I have a contingency. Diana was right about the risk. If the plan goes south, we're gonna bring in the big guns.

Alfred Pennyworth: But that's not... Those are very big guns! You've got a team here.

Bruce Wayne: Superman could bring this team together better than I ever could. His strength...

Alfred Pennyworth: It doesn't matter how strong you are. Or what abilities you might have...

Bruce Wayne: He was more human than I am. He lived in this world. Fell in love, had a job. In spite of all that power...

Bruce Wayne: The world needs Superman. And the team needs Clark.

Alfred Pennyworth: And what does Clark need? Maybe he's at peace.

Bruce Wayne: He'll get over it.

Barry Allen: You know, I can do this a lot faster. I just... Is it weird that it feels disrespectful?

Victor Stone: Yep.

Barry Allen: Do you feel a sense of confidence that we're not doing something horribly wrong and macabre here?

Victor Stone: Not really.

Barry Allen: Okay then why are...

Victor Stone: Because I saw Steppenwolf up close. The stories Diana told us? And I believe them.

Barry Allen: But we're gonna stop him.

Victor Stone: That's the plan.

Barry Allen: That's the plan! Okay, we're not ready for... Racially charged...

Victor Stone: You got struck by lightning, huh?

Barry Allen: Yeah... That's the abridged version. - And you...?

Victor Stone: Explosion. Woke up in a lab.

Barry Allen: We're, we're the accidents. Yeah, that's us.

Hey! We're approaching the Kryptonian ship. ETA, 30 seconds. I'm here for him. - I swear, I would never... - Save it. - Okay. - Okay! Okay. This is amazing. This is crazy. What, now it's crazy? You lunatics better know what you're doing. Lex Luthor fried the circuits bringing his creature to life. There's not enough charge to wake the Box. I might be able to do it. I might be able to jumpstart it, I... If I can get enough distance... I can conduct a significant electrical current. I might be able to wake the Box, if that's still what we want? We have to try. This must be the end of the line, so... I'm in position. The Mother Box is ready. You have to charge it the moment it touches the fluid. - Five. - Five...

Diana's right. This is a bad idea.

Four.

Three.

Three...

Two.

Two. One.

Give us an ETA on all additional units...

He's back.

Aquaman: He's not all right.

Cyborg: He's scanning us. What?

Aquaman: Arthur, you need to relax. Your adrenaline's spiking.

Aquaman: Because he's not all right!

Flash: Oh, no. Should we bow? Or show our bellies?

[Suddenly, Victor's defense mechanisms begin to activate]

Flash: Victor... Victor, stop.

Cyborg: Shit!

Flash: What are you doing?

Cyborg: It's my armor's defense system... - No. It's stronger since the interface... - I can't control it.

Flash: Victor, no! Shut it off! Think of happy thoughts, Victor!

[Victor's defense mechanisms shoot at Clark, leading the Kryptonian to believe they are hostile]

Wonder Woman: Kal-El, no!

[Clark then begins to battle the Justice League at Heroes Park.]

Wonder Woman: He's confused, he doesn't know who he is!

The Flash: Pet Cemetery.

Wonder Woman: Arthur, we need to restrain him.

Cyborg: I got him.

[While Cyborg and Aquaman distract Superman, Wonder Woman wraps her Lasso of Truth around Superman]

Wonder Woman: Kal-El, the last son of Krypton. Remember who you are! Tell me who you...

[Superman pulls Wonder Woman towards her and tosses her, Cyborg and Aquaman all aside. Flash attempts to use his speed to subude Superman, but Superman is more than able to keep up and defeats Barry. At this point, Batman steps in]

Batman: Clark.

Clark: [Regonizing Batman] I know you.

[Wonder Woman lands on the ground to stop Superman from approaching Batman, but Superman effortlessly defeats her and then slaps Batman, sending the masked vigilante flying against a police car. Out of options, Batman contacts Alfred.]

Batman: Alfred, I need the big gu-

[Superman grabs Batman by the chin and lifts him up into the air]

Clark: You did this.

Batman: I had to.

Clark: You won't let me live. You won't let me die.

Batman: The world needs you.

Clark: But does it need you? Tell me, do you bleed?

[Before Superman can crush Batman's chin, Alfred arrive with "the big guns": Lois Lane. She steps out of the limousine and speaks to Superman]

Lois Lane: Clark? Clark. Please... Please. Please, just go. Yeah? Let's go.

Batman: Yeah... Yeah. Something's definitely bleeding.

[The heroes hear a nearby boom tube, where they had left the last Mother Box while they were dealing with Superman. Steppenwolf swiftly takes advantage of their distraction and retrieves it]

Diana Prince: The Mother Box. He has the last one.

[Meanwhile, Lois and Clark return to the Kent farm in order to restore the latter's memories]

Lois Lane: You brought us here. You remembered.

Clark Kent: This is home.

Lois Lane: You smell good.

Clark Kent: Did I not before?

Bruce Wayne: Don't do that.

We just got our asses handed to us and Steppenwolf has got the third Box.

So we find them. If the Boxes are even close to each other there's going to be some kind of energy surge.

And Steppenwolf's gonna be keeping them somewhere where they don't read. No internet, no satellite coverage.

That narrows it down.

Not enough.

Arthur Curry: So, you can't find them... or maybe you don't want to.

Bruce Wayne: Arthur.

Arthur Curry: Yeah, that was a great way to get rid of Superman.

Victor Stone: Man, I'm not doing this on purpose.

Arthur Curry: Right. Because you can't control the machine.

Barry Allen: Right, so is this a- a bad time to bring up my blood sugar? Very hungry...

Diana Prince: Victor... You can find the Boxes. You share their energy. I know it's frightening. But if you go under, I promise, we will pull you back out.

Victor Stone: Just keep the Little Merman away from me while I work.

Bruce: Barry, go find Alfred in the pantry. Then come back, get online. Everybody checks everybody else's work.

[Bruce walks over to Arthur.]

Bruce Wayne: Listen, just wanted if you could, put out a, if you were, an aquatic... You know... I mean, do you talk to fish?

Arthur Curry: The water does the talking.

Bruce Wayne: Of course.

Arthur Curry: If the current comes in strange, I'm gonna point the way.

Bruce Wayne: Okay.

Diana Prince: Wait. Let me.

Bruce Wayne: It's just a little out of place.

Bruce Wayne: So, Clark seemed to share your view on being woken up.

Diana Prince: He could've killed you.

Bruce Wayne: I was willing to make the trade.

Diana Prince: And bringing in Lois Lane?

Bruce Wayne: Remember what you told me about heart, in the hangar? I bet you thought I wasn't listening.

[Diana pops his shoulder.]

Bruce Wayne: Thank you.

Diana Prince: You know, you can't do this forever.

Bruce Wayne: I can barely do it now. Steppenwolf... This is the job.

Diana Prince: It's my job. And I haven't been doing it. I've been reacting. Not leading. You know, what you said about Steve Trevor...

Bruce Wayne: That wasn't my business. I'm sorry.

Diana Prince: You were pushing me to lead the team. But leaders get people killed. I fought, always, when I was needed. But to lead, to step into the light and to say to people: "This is worth your life?" When it's your fault... They're all Steve Trevor.

Bruce Wayne: We make it through tonight... You can stay in the shadows forever. Dress up like a bat. I won't even sue.

Diana Prince: If... we get through the night.

Lois Lane: Are you okay? You brought us here, but you've hardly spent a minute in the house.

Clark Kent: I know, I just... Just got out of a wooden box?

Lois Lane: What was it like? Coming back?

Clark Kent: Itchy. I mean, honestly... Weird, in so many ways. But, mostly just-

Lois Lane: I wasn't strong. I didn't, um... You would've been very disappointed in me. I wasn't... "Lois Lane, Dedicated Reporter". I... I was just...

Clark Kent: It's okay. I'm the idiot who left. But I'm back now. And I'm gonna make things right.

[Lois and Clark kiss and she pulls him in for a hug. They stay that way for a few moments before Clark smiles.]

Clark Kent: You called mom.

Lois Lane: Of course.

Clark Kent: Thank you.

Lois Lane: I was hoping it was gonna take you longer to, uh, recover.

Clark Kent: Why?

Lois Lane: Because now, I have to send you away.

Clark: Bruce.

Lois Lane: He needs you. Fate of the world. I think that's the deal. He was... Pretty tense.

Clark: Well, I guess I do owe him one.

Lois Lane: Right. But no dying. And I get the exclusive.

Clark Kent: Yes, ma'am.

[Martha's truck pulls up to the Kent farm and she gets out, walking to Clark.]

Martha Kent: You're really you?

Clark Kent: I'm really me, ma.

At last. Praise to the Unity. The three is one. Praise to the Mother of Horrors. Is Steppenwolf there? Sorry. It's Porzenov. In Northern Russia. The Nuclear Plant. Had a meltdown 30 years ago. There have been some attempts to resettle nearby... ...but it looks like really rough sledding. Who picks this place to put down roots? People that are making it count everywhere else. The Earth starts changing... ...it'll hit them first. How long have we got? A few hours. Transport won't fly that fast. It will for me. The Unity brings all three boxes together in perfect sync. Its power builds until it can't be contained. But if I can cause a delay between each box, even for a nanosecond... Its energy will cascade. Form a loop. And they'll feed on each other.

The Flash: And that's it? We just pull them apart? No fuss, no muss?

Cyborg: Separating the boxes is still gonna cause a massive surge. I have to be there. But you guys should think about getting clear.

Wonder Woman: We're with you 'till it's done.

Aquaman: Honestly, I think we're gonna be dead way before that. And you know what? I don't mind. It's an honorable end. But we've gotta shut Steppenwolf down. Superman's a no-show. You've got no powers. No offense. This guy might be working for the enemy. We don't know. You're tripping over your feet, and mine... You're gorgeous. And fierce. And strong. And mmh. I know we went to war with the Amazons, but... but that was before my time. You know what? I don't wanna die. I'm young. There's shit that I wanna do. I just feel like... I didn't really embrace the sea or the land. I've been a loner my whole life. But being part of something bigger, like this... Maybe I'm scared because... I'm meant to--

[Arthur, at Bruce's gesturing, reaches down and pulls out the Lasso of Truth. With a steely gaze, he tosses it back to Diana, who catches it effortlessly.]

Wonder Woman: I think that was beautiful.

Aquaman: You say a word about this, and you'll meet every prawn I know.

The Flash: I honestly didn't hear anything after "We're all gonna die."

Steppenwolf: Let them come.

Batman: [To the Justice League] I'm gonna take out that tower and knock down that shield dome. You get to Steppenwolf. Don't wait for me, just do the job.

Batman: Alright, Alfred. Are we set to broadcast?

Alfred Pennyworth: Playing all your favorite hits.

Batman: Come on, follow me, you damn insects. They're coming. They're all coming.

Alfred Pennyworth: Ah. We might not have thought this through.

Cyborg: He's clearing the field.

Wonder Woman: He won't last three minutes.

Aquaman: Then let's use them.

Wonder Woman: On my lead.

They're leaving. Papa. Everyone, get out!

Batman: Son of a bitch.

The Flash: Oh, snap!

Cyborg: You're welcome.

[Aquaman stands on top of the Batmobile as if it's a surfboard.]

Aquaman: Yeah!

Batman: This isn't the plan.

Alfred Pennyworth: No, Master Wayne. This is the team.

Cyborg: Hey, blame the lady. We would've left you, but she didn't ask for a vote.

Aquaman: So, your genius move is dying? You really are out of your mind.

Batman: I'm not the one who brought a pitchfork.

Aquaman: [Jumps off the Batmobile to attack a Parademon] Yahoo!

Cyborg: [Saves Aquaman] Ride ain't over yet.

Aquaman: My man!

[Wonder Woman confronts Steppenwolf within the structure. He turns around to face her]

Wonder Woman: Is this what conquering is? Hiding from the fight?

Steppenwolf: Oh, no. You're all mi-

[Aquaman tackles Steppenwolf from behind while he is distracted with his conversation with Wonder Woman. The two proceed to engage him in battle. Meanwhile, the Flash flies Cyborg over to the Mother Boxes]

Cyborg: Thanks for the lift.

The Flash: Yeah, no problem. You got this?

Cyborg: These things are gonna keep coming.

The Flash: Okay. You get technical, I'm on bug duty.

Cyborg: Let's do it.

The Flash: [After he defeated the robot bugs] YES! That was gross. Ugh! Thank you!

Cyborg: [Connecting to the Mother Boxes] This is... This is a lot.

[Steppenwolf overpowers Aquaman and Wonder Woman, then goes over to Cyborg and lifts him up by the throat]

Steppenwolf: Now, do you see it?

[Wonder Woman shatters the bridge that Steppenwolf and Cyborg are standing on, sending them both plummeting to the lower levels]

Alfred Pennyworth: Whatever you're in the middle of, it's spreading for miles. Satellites show civilians moving east. They're not gonna make it.

Batman: Barry. I need you to take a walk.

The Flash: God, I hope this is east.

[Cyborg gets back to the Mother Boxes, but Steppenwolf swiftly follows and slams his axe into Cyborg's shoulder. Cyborg shoots Steppenwolf in the shoulder]

Steppenwolf: You are not worthy! To touch Mother!

[Steppenwolf grabs Cyborg and lifts him up into the air]

Steppenwolf: She is power, and power is the ONLY law!

[Steppenwolf rips Cyborg's left leg off, severely injuring the hero. He lifts his hand up to punch him.]

Steppenwolf: You're all too weak to see the truth.

Superman: Well... I believe in truth. But I'm also a big fan of justice.

[Superman (having regained his memories) arrives and punches Steppenwolf, sending him flying against a wall.]

Aquaman: Alright.

Steppenwolf: Kryptonian!

[Steppenwolf rushes to attack Superman, but Superman effortlessly dodges the attack and sends Steppenwolf plummeting to the lower levels. Wonder Woman and Aquaman resume struggling with him]

Superman: So, how do I help?

Batman: [Indicates Victor] We buy him some time, we can stop that box from destroying all life on earth. We hope.

Superman: Well, I knew you didn't bring me back cause you liked me.

Batman: [Awkwardly] I don't... not...

Superman: Civilians.

Batman: Barry's headed...

Superman: There's too many of them.

[Superman leaves to help the Flash save the Russian civilians.]

The Flash: Okay. This is definitely east.

Superman: [Flying alongside Flash] Slowpoke.

The Flash: Oh, it's on!

Superman: I'll take the ones on the right.

The Flash: It's okay! Uh, hold on. Hold on. Yeah.

[Superman lifts an entire building full of Russian civilians to safety.]

The Flash: [To a little girl] Dostoyevsky.

[Meanwhile, Aquaman and Wonder Woman manage to gain the upper hand against Steppenwolf and throw him onto a wall.]

Superman: Is this guy still bothering you?

[Returning to the nuclear facility, Superman begins attacking Steppenwolf again, then uses his heat vision and throws him into another wall to fall onto the ground.]

Cyborg: Superman! We gotta pull these things apart. Couple of more seconds, you'll see your opening.

Superman: Any blow-back?

Cyborg: Big-time. But I think we can take it.

Superman: Good. Cause I really like being alive.

Cyborg: So do I.

[Once the three Mother Boxes are removing themselves slowly, Superman manages to get his hands on them to separate two of them, which leads to a big explosion, and the sky of the earth is back to its normal color.]

Batman: Clark.

[The smoke clears, revealing Superman and Cyborg knocked flat.]

Superman: I take it back. I wanna die.

[They laugh weakly.]

Cyborg: Man, my toes hurt! I don't even understand the physics of how my toes hurt!

[They laugh harder.]

Wonder Woman: Children. I work with children.

The Flash: Uh, have you guys seen what's going on outsi-

[An enraged Steppenwolf grabs the Flash by the head from behind and hurls him against a wall, incapacitating the Speedster. Aquaman immediately reacts, hurling his trident into Steppenwolf's chest and punching him backwards. Undeterred, Steppenwolf begins to get up again]

Steppenwolf: I am the End of Worlds. Who are you to defy me?! This world is my right!

[Wonder Woman goes in to strike the New God and Superman utilizes his arctic breath to Steppenwolf's weapon cold and brittle, enough so for Wonder Woman to destroy his weapon.]

Steppenwolf: NO! This cannot be!

Aquaman: Recognize that smell?

[All the Parademons turn towards and begin screeching at Steppenwolf.]

Batman: Fear.

[Because of Steppenwolf's electro-axe being destroyed, in an ironic twist of fate, Steppenwolf begins to feel fear, rousing the appetites of his Parademons and turning them against him. Despite his fear, Steppenwolf tries to fight back, but is overwhelmed by the angry Parademons.]

Steppenwolf: No, leave me!! Get off from me! I command you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you all!

[Steppenwolf is last seen being ravaged by his army as the Mother Box teleports him away, leaving only his helmet behind.]

Cyborg: Booyah.

Superman: [Seeing plant-life growing] Glad I didn't miss this.

Wonder Woman: So am I.

Batman: Yeah. Now she's glad.

Clark Kent: "Thank you" is... not enough for what you did.

Bruce Wayne: I just undid a mistake. That's all.

Clark Kent: How did you get the house back from the bank?

Bruce Wayne: I bought the bank.

Clark Kent: The whole bank?

Bruce Wayne: It's like a reflex with me, I don't know...

Henry Allen: What?

Barry Allen: It's actually the, worst job you can get in a crime lab. But, uh... My- My foot's in the door. Yeah. I got a recommendation from a friend.

Henry Allen: This is like a "job" job?

Barry Allen: "Job" job.

Henry Allen: Look at you go!

Lois Lane: Darkness. The truest darkness is not the absence of light. It is the conviction that the light will never return.

Bruce Wayne: Must be a hundred, hundred and fifty feet.

Alfred: Must be...

Bruce Wayne: Big round table. Six chairs, right there.

Diana Prince: But room for more.

Bruce Wayne: But room for more.

Lois Lane: But the light always returns to show us things familiar. Home. Family. And things entirely new. Or long overlooked. It shows us new possibilities... And challenges us to pursue them.

Robber: Yeah. And Jerry Menasco runs the whole kit. I mean, he did the Bilbao job 2 years ago? Yeah, he has it all in storage in Croydon.

Police Officer: The Belgian.

Robber: Right, yeah. The Belgian...

Lois Lane: This time, the light shone on the heroes. Coming out of the shadows to tell us we won't be alone again. Our darkness was deep and seemed to swallow all hope. But these heroes were here the whole time. To remind us that hope is real. That you can see it.

Lois Lane: All you have to do is look... Up in the sky...

[Clark performs the classic Superman shirt rip and takes off, rising up in the sky. He disappears with a sonic boom.]

[Credits]

[Fade in on Superman and the Flash standing in a grassy field.]

The Flash: I can't tell you how much I appreciate you doing this.

Superman: Not at all, Barry. I'm curious, myself.

The Flash: Yeah! And it's not like a competition, you know? Well, it... It is a competition. But, y'know, it's not like a macho, uh... measuring thing.

Superman: But if I win, you're off the team.

[The Flash readjusts his position, concerned, before Superman breaks into a smile. Flash laughs, relieved.]

Superman: No... If I win... Bruce said something about you having to take us all to "brunch"...?

The Flash: Oh, see, now that's cold. That's a betrayal. I feel stung by that.

[Beat.]

The Flash: Okay, but if I win, I get to tell everyone!

Superman: Deal.

[They shake on it.]

Superman: Which coast?

The Flash: You know, I've never seen the Pacific!

[Flash points to his left. Superman pulls a face and points right.]

The Flash: Which is that way, because... The sun, and it's...

[They ready themselves, with Flash lighting a sparkler with his fingers and throwing it on the ground. They then both set off, Superman flying and Flash running towards the camera. Cut to black.]

[Credits]

[Cut to Arkham Asylum. There's a huge transfer of prisoners going on.]

Guard: Alright, just keep it moving.

Nelson: [Over loudspeaker] C'mon, Luthor, let's go.

[Luthor, standing in his cell, does not move. His back is turned to the guards and, by extension, us.]

Nelson: [Over loudspeaker] Luthor!

[Still nothing. Nelson exits and walks towards Luthor's cell, stopping just outside the door.]

Nelson: Alright, stop joking around, Luthor, I'm gonna have to come in there.

[Nelson turns him around, revealing a random bald man who laughs insanely. Cut to an out of focus shot of someone on a speedboat. They're wearing a helmet, and he has two katanas on their back. A pull back reveals that the driver's heading towards a yacht. The driver -- Deathstroke -- pulls up and walks up the steps.]

Lex Luthor: Ah! There he is, welcome aboard. Care for a glass of Gout De Diamant? I was just celebrating God's return out of the ground and back up into the sky! He and his odd little friends are forming some sort of... League.

Deathstroke: You'd better not be wasting my time.

Lex Luthor: No, I have too much to live for. And more important things to do. We have to level the playing field, Mr. Wilson. To put it plainly... Shouldn't we have a League of our own?

[Pull back from the yacht and into the Atlas Entertainment logo. Cut to black.]
