[After the opening logos, leaves start falling and we hear a voiceover.]

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): There was a time above... A time before...

[The camera pans up, two coffins are being carried to a crypt.]

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): There were perfect things. Diamond absolutes. But things fall... Things on Earth...

[Cut to another angle, a mansion is seen in the distance, and three people are ahead of the coffins: an elderly man, a British guy with a hat (ALFRED PENNYWORTH) and a boy....]

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): And what falls is fallen.

[...who just before entering the crypt starts running.]

ALFRED: Master Wayne! Bruce! Bruce, are you alright?!

As young Bruce Wayne passes by tombstones, he enters a nearby forest. Cut to black.


OPENING CREDITS

[Scenes of Bruce Wayne running through the woods and eventually falling down an open trapdoor are intercut with the events that lead to the funeral, where outside a screening of Zorro Bruce's parents THOMAS and MARTHA WAYNE are shot by a mugger.]

THOMAS: Martha...

[In the underground cave, Bruce sees an enormous group of bats hanging from a nearby ceiling. They wake up and fly in his direction. Eventually Bruce calms down, is surrounded, and starts floating towards the open trapdoor as the circle of bats fly towards there. As the screen turns to white, the voiceover returns. .]

BRUCE WAYNE (VO): In the dream they took me to the light. A beautiful lie.

[Letters in the white screen…]

METROPOLIS - MANKIND IS INTRODUCED TO SUPERMAN

Cut to: METROPOLIS HARBOR

[A helicopter is landing as above him fighter jets shoot missiles. Out of the helicopter comes adult BRUCE WAYNE, who runs as soon as he hits the ground.]

[We see what Bruce is looking at and where the jets intend to shoot – the Kryptonian ship floating above the center of Metropolis, firing a beam to destroy the area below it. A falling jet crashes on an overpass just as Bruce starts the car, driving towards the carnage.]

[Bruce drives in the mostly empty streets as fire, debris and dust clouds occasionally force him to turn corners. He then grabs his cell phone and makes a call.]

Cut to: OFFICE

[In the Wayne Financial office room, an elderly executive answers the phone.]

BRUCE WAYNE (O.S.): Jack.

JACK: Bruce.

[Bruce in the car.]

BRUCE WAYNE: Jack, listen to me. I want you to get everyone out of the building. Right now.

[Jack staring at the Kryptonian ship from his window.]

BRUCE WAYNE (O.S.): You understand?

[Once the gravity beam hits the ground, destroying nearby skyscrapers, the Wayne Financial employees scream. Two women even say "Oh my God" and "Away from the windows!" Jack downs the phone and starts screaming at the employees.]

JACK: Let's go. Come on, start moving now, people, let's go! The boss wants us out of the building, so let's make it happen!

[People are leaving as we cut to Bruce driving again.]

BRUCE WAYNE: Jack. Jack!

[Letting off the phone, Bruce continues taking turns as he faces cars crashing, planes falling, and firemen barricades. At a certain point, we see above the car the falling Fortress of Solitude, which is crashing into the city, bringing down several skyscrapers in the process.]

[Once Bruce sees a crowd standing in the middle of the street and the Kryptonian ship not firing beams anymore, he stops. Bruce steps out of the vehicle, seeing a plane - with lightning coming out of it - crash into the spacecraft, before igniting something that sends in a loud blast at the crowd around Bruce. As the ship is sucked in by some sort of singularity, Bruce runs down the chaotic streets.]

[Back at Wayne Financial, Jack stands at the empty office, staring at the destroyed downtown from the window. A building is blasted and the projectile is flying towards the Wayne building - Superman and Zod. They hit the floors below Jack's offices; the building shakes and lights flicker.]

[At that time, Bruce is on a street where he can see his building, and tries calling Jack again. Just as the automated error message (“We're sorry. All services are busy now. Will you please try your call again later.“) plays, Wayne sees a heat vision beam shredding through the Wayne Financial Building.]

[Back in the office, whose floor is being ripped apart by beams, Jack, still by the window, says a prayer.

JACK: And may Almighty God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, have mercy on my soul.

[Bruce watches in horror as the building collapses.]

BRUCE WAYNE: JACK!!!

[Bruce fearlessly runs right into the falling debris, desperate to try and save someone - in contrast to all the others are running away. The dust engulfs him.]

At the dusty yet silent ruins, Bruce passes by a police horse and some people before hearing someone call his name.

WALLACE

Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

Wallace Keefe is on the ground, his legs trapped underneath rubble. Bruce approaches him.

WALLACE

I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs.

BRUCE WAYNE

We need help over here!

WALLACE

Help me. [grabs Bruce's arm] I can't feel my legs.

BRUCE WAYNE

You're going to be okay, you hear me? [sees the name tag] Wallace. What do they call you, Wally? Huh?

WALLACE

You're the boss, Boss.

Bruce gives an asserting smile before taking Wallace's hand off him as some people have arrived to help. Two grab Wallace by his arms and lift him...

BYSTANDERS

Alright. You're going to be okay. Easy, easy. Come on.

...and then Bruce lifts the debris. Wallace is pulled back, his lower legs visibly damaged.

WALLACE

Oh my god. I can't feel my legs. I can't... I can't feel my legs.

Bruce sees a girl about to be crushed by falling debris, and saves her.

BRUCE WAYNE It's okay. You're going to be okay. You're okay, alright. Huh. Okay, you know what? We're going to find your mom. Where is she?

The crying girl points at a destroyed skyscraper. Bruce gives her a hug to comfort her as he looks up to the sky and witness as meteorites fall on another building - along with the battling Superman and General Zod out of the sky. Eventually another skyscraper prevents Bruce from seeing the rest of the battle, but he still angrily stares at what the Kryptonians have done.

Cut to black, then text reading 18 MONTHS LATER.

SOMEWHERE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN

In front of a destroyed Kryptonian artifact, a team of Indian divers explore an underwater area and take a strange rock from the seafloor.

They bring it back to land, showing the rock to an elderly white man. Breaking it with an axe, he finds inside a large nugget of a green mineral – Kryptonite.

[Cut to RUINS. The door was that of a stone bunker in a seemingly desertic location, covered in ruins and barbed wire. Pillars of fire similar to volcanoes surround the area. Batman looks through a pair of binoculars. A fleet of truck arrives in the ruin compound. Batman approaches a truck as its back door opens.]

Batman: Did you get it? The rock?

Man: Yeah, we got it.

[Batman enters the truck, opens a LexCorp box, and finds only green light bulbs.]

Man: [pointing a gun at Batman] I'm sorry.

[Stormtroopers with Superman’s shield as shoulder patches reveal themselves to Batman and his allies.]

Troopers: Get down! Get down now!

[Another soldier points his rifle at Batman. He holds his hands up, and by turning around sees his men being executed.]

Batman: No!

[Angered, he begins a killing spree, gunning down and brutally beating the multiple stormtroopers working for Superman. Although he manages to take down most of the stormtroopers while Parademons invade the area and abduct many of his resistance fighters, Batman is eventually overwhelmed by the remaining stormtroopers there who could barely restrain him. He snaps one of their necks but then is brutally (but barely) beaten down and restrained by the other stormtroopers. Seeing the damage that Batman was inflicting on the stormtroopers and their inability to restrain him, a Parademon knocks him unconscious. Cut to UNDERGROUND BUNKER. Batman recuperates chained up in the bunker with his remaining allies, eyeing them helplessly. Superman himself then lands in the bunker, and his stormtroopers reverently bow before their leader. He approaches Batman, swiftly murdering the latter's other allies with his heat vision. Superman then unmasks the infuriated vigilante.]

Superman: She was my world. And you took her from me.

[Superman then rips out Batman's heart.]

Batman: GGAAHHHHH!

[CUT TO: BATCAVE. Bruce awoke from this nightmare to find a distorted and unstable blue portal of electricity right in front of him. Inside it is a mysterious time traveler...]

The Flash: BRUCE! Listen to me now! It's Lois! It's Lois Lane! She's the key! Am I too soon? AAAAH!! I'M TOO SOON! You're right about him! You've always been right about him! Fear him! FIND US, BRUCE! You have to find us!

[Bruce wakes up again. That was all a dream. The computer reads DECRYPTING [100%] - [DECRYPTION COMPLETE] before opening a LexCorp branded interface.]
