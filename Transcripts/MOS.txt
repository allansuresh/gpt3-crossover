[First lines; on the planet Krypton, Jor-El helps his wife Lara as she gives birth to their son, later Jor-El meets with the Kryptonian Council]

Jor-El: Do you not understand? Krypton’s core is collapsing, we may only have a matter of weeks. I warned you, harvesting the core was suicide. It has accelerated the process of implosion.

Lor-Em: Our energy reserves were exhausted. What would you have us do, El?

Jor-El: Look to the stars, like our ancestors did! There are inhabitable worlds within reach. We can begin by using the old outposts.

Ro-Zar: Are you seriously suggesting that we evacuate the entire planet?

Jor-El: No, everybody here is already dead. Give me control of the codex, I will ensure the survival of our race. There’s still hope. I have held that hope in my hands.

[He’s interrupted by noises from outside the chamber, Jor-El looks behind him and sees General Zod and his forces breaking into the council.]

General Zod: This Council has been disbanded.

Ro-Zar: On whose authority?

General Zod: Mine.

[Zod points his weapon at Ro-Zar, shoots and kills her]

General Zod: The rest of you will be tried and punished accordingly.

[Jor-El walks toward Zod]

Jor-El: What are you doing, Zod? This is madness!

General Zod: What I should have done years ago. These lawmakers, with their endless debates, have led Krypton to ruin!

Jor-El: And if your forces prevail, you’ll be the leader of nothing!

General Zod: Then join me, help me save our ways. We’ll start anew, we’ll sever the degenerative bloodlines that led us to this state.

Jor-El: And who will decide which bloodline survives, Zod? You?

General Zod: Don’t do this, El. The last thing I want is for us to be enemies.

Jor-El: You have abandoned the principles that bound us together. You’ve taken up the sword against your own people. I’ll honor the man you once were, Zod. Not this monster you’ve become.

[Jor-El steps back, Zod turns to his army]

General Zod: Take him away.

[As Jor-El is being marched away by Zod’s men, Kelex, the service levitating robot, appears]

Kelex: Sir, is everything alright?

Tor-An: Out of the way!

[Jor-El nods his head slightly]

Tor-An: I said…

[Kelor uses a burst of light to give Jor-El his chance to strike at the two men holding him and manages to take them down and take their weapon; to Kelex]

Jor-El: Get me Lara.

[a metallic robotic version of Lara’s face appears on Kelex]
Lara Lor-Van: Jor, behind you!
[Jor-El turns and quickly shoots two of Zod’s men appearing behind him]
Jor-El: Lara, you have to ready the launch. I’ll be with you as soon as I can.
[outside, Jor-El sees chaos ensuing around the planet, he calls to winged creature, H’Raka, that lands before him, he hops on its back and it flies off, Kelex appears beside Jor-El]
Jor-El: Can you see the codex?
Kelex: It’s just beneath the central hub, sir. But I’m compelled to warn you, breaching the Genesis Chamber is a Class-B crime.
Jor-El: Nobody cares anymore, Kelex. The world is about to come to an end.
[Jor-El leaps down and swims to the central hub, where all Kryptonian babies are kept, and retrieves the codex, as he gets out of the water he’s confronted by Zod’s ships]
Voice from Ship: Jor-El, by the authority of General Zod, surrender the codex.
[the ship shoots at Jor-El, who misses it by jumping down and as he falls down H’Raka suddenly flies in and carries him off]
Jor-El: Easy, H’Raka.
[they finally reach the citadel where Lara is with the baby, Jor-El places the codex on the ship]
Jor-El: Did you find the world?
Lara Lor-Van: We have.
Kelex: Orbiting the main sequence yellow star, just as you said it would.
[Kelex shows them earth]
Jor-El: It’s a young star. His cells will drink it’s radiation. It’s a seemingly intelligent population.
Lara Lor-Van: He’ll be an outcast, a freak. They’ll kill him.
Jor-El: No, he’ll be a God to them.
Lara Lor-Van: What if the ship doesn’t make it? He’ll die out there, alone.
[looking down at her baby in her arms]
Lara Lor-Van: I can’t do it. I thought I could, but…
Jor-El: Lara…
Lara Lor-Van: Now that he’s here.
Jor-El: Krypton is doomed. It’s his only chance now. It’s our people’s only hope.
Jor-El: What is it, Kelex?
Kelex: There are five attack ships converging from east. Citadel’s defenses are being scanned and evaluated.
Jor-El: I’ll upload the codex.
Lara Lor-Van: No, wait.
Jor-El: Lara…
Lara Lor-Van: Just let me look at him.
[she looks down at the baby in her arms]
Lara Lor-Van: We’ll never get to see him walk, never hear him say our names.
[Lara prepares for the ship containing Kal-El to be launched]
Kelex: Lady Lara, the Phantom prods are coming online.
Lara Lor-Van: Proceed to ignition.
[as Zod and his forces enter the citadel]
Faora-Ul: General, we have identified an engine ignition within the citadel.
General Zod: The launch. Hold this platform, commander.
[as Zod enters further into the citadel, Jo-El emerges in full armor]
General Zod: I know you stole the codex, Jor-El. Surrender it and I’ll let you live.
Jor-El: This is a second chance for all of Krypton, not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.
General Zod: What have you done?
Jor-El: We’ve had a child, Zod. A boy child. Krypton’s first natural birth in centuries, and he will be free, free to forge his own destiny.
General Zod: Heresy!
[to his men]
General Zod: Destroy it!
[Jor-El shoots Zod’s men down then Zod and Jor-El start fighting with Jor-El managing to subdue Zod as Lara prepares for the ship to launch]
General Zod: Lara, listen to me! The codex is Krypton’s future! Abort the launch!
[Lara and Jor-El look at each other for a moment before Lara finally pushes the button that launches the ship]
General Zod: Nooo!!!
[Zod screams in fury and impales Jor-El with his knife making Jor-El fall to his death, Lara runs to Jor-El’s body and kneels beside him, crying]
General Zod: Your son, Lara. Where have you sent him?
Lara Lor-Van: His name is Kal, son of El, and he’s beyond your reach.
[Zod walks up to the rest of his forces]
General Zod: Bring that ship down.
[as Zod’s ship is about to shoot the ship carrying Kal-El, his ship is shot down by the council’s forces]
Council Force: Lay down your weapons, your forces are surrounded.
[Zod and his forces are brought before the council]
Lor-Em: General Zod, for the crimes of murder and high treason, the Council has sentenced and your fellow insurgence to three hundred cycles of schematic reconditioning. Do you have any last words?
[Zod makes a move toward Lor-Em but is stopped]
General Zod: You won’t kill us yourself! You won’t sully your hands, but you’ll damn us to a black hole for eternity!
[he spits at Lor-Em]
General Zod: Jor-El was right, you’re a pack of fools! Every last one of you!
[he suddenly turns and walks toward Lara]
General Zod: You…believe your son is safe? I will find him. I will reclaim what you have taken from us!
[he’s pushed away by the council’s forces]
General Zod: I will find him. I will find him, Lara. I will find him!
[Zod and his forces are frozen and sent to the ship that will carry out their sentence]
[as the planet is being destroyed, Lara touches Jor-El’s armor and walks toward the edge of the home with her two service robots following her ]
Kelor: Lady Lara, shouldn’t you find refuge?
Lara Lor-Van: There is no refuge, Kelor. Jor-El was right, this is the end.
[she watches has her planet gets destroyed]
Lara Lor-Van: Make a better world than ours, Kal.
[as she stands, Lara is consumed in the planet’s destruction and Krypton is obliterated, at the same time we see the ship holding Kal-El heading toward earth]
[years later, we see an adult Kal-El/Clark working on a boat with other fishermen; as Clark is working he’s suddenly saved by another fisherman as one of the metal fishnets hanging above is about to fall on him]
Byrne: Watch it, dumbass! Keep your eyes open or you’re gonna get squashed!
[he gives Clark a hand to stand]
Byrne: Where the hell did they find you, Greenhorn?
Heraldson: Gentlemen secure the deck, we just got a distress call from a rig due west of us. Secure the deck!
[the boat goes toward the oil rig in distress, Clark hears the Heraldson talking to the coast guard in the helicopter]
Coast Guard #1: All civilian, stand clear. Subsea valves failed and the rig is about to explode.
Heraldson: Roger, coast guard. What about the men left inside? Over.
Coast Guard #1: Forget ’em, they’re dead.
[to Clark]
Heraldson: Greenhorn, fetch me my binoculars.
[Clark doesn’t respond]
Heraldson: Greenhorn!
[he turns to see Clark has disappeared]
[we see Clark at the oil rig trying to rescue the people inside]
Oil Rig Worker: This is the last of the oxygen! I don’t know how much longer we can hold out!
[suddenly they see the metal door being thrown aside and Clark emerging through the oil rig fire]
Coast Guard #1: This is coast guard 6-5-10. We’re gonna make one more pass, then we’re getting out of here.
[he sees Clark emerging out of the oil rig with the workers]
Coast Guard #1: Wait, wait, wait! I got some guys on the heli-pad!
[the helicopter lands and Clark helps the oil rig workers get onto the helicopter, then just as the helicopter is about to take off, he sees the burning oil rig about to collapse on the helicopter]
Coast Guard #2: Get that last guy loaded. We have got to go!
[to Clark]
Coast Guard #1: Hey, let’s go! What are you doing?
[at that moment Clark manages to hold off the large heavy metal collapsing from the oil rig onto the helicopter; the helicopter manages to take off safely but finally collapses and takes Clark with him into the ocean]
[as Clark is floating in the ocean he has a flashback to his childhood in Kansas, he’s in his elementary school class and his teacher is writing something on the black board and asks young Clark a question]
Ms. Rampling: Clark? Are you listening, Clark?
[Clark looks disorientated and doesn’t seem to hear the teacher, she walks up to Clark]
Ms. Rampling: I asked you to tell me who first settled in Kansas?
[Clark looks at his teacher and his heightened senses (x-ray vision, hearing, etc.) start to overwhelm him]
Ms. Rampling: Are you alright, Clark?
[Clark runs out of the class]
Ms. Rampling: Clark! Clark!
[he gets into the janitor’s closet and locks himself inside]
Ms. Rampling: Clark!
[the teacher tries knocks on the janitor’s door, trying to get Clark to come out]
Ms. Rampling: Clark, come out of there.
Clark Kent (9 Years): Leave me alone!
[we see all the school kids have gathered outside the Janitor’s door surrounding the teacher]
Ms. Rampling: Clark, I have called your mother. Clark!
[getting annoyed, Clark uses his heat vision to burn the metal door handle, making the teacher take her hand off the handle as it burns her]
[Clark’s adoptive mother Martha runs through the school corridor]
Martha Kent: Clark, I’m here. Clark, honey, it’s mom.
[Martha walks up to the door]
Martha Kent: Can you open the door?
[with his superhuman hearing, Clark hears the other kids talking about him and he starts crying]
Martha Kent: Sweetie, how can I help you if you won’t let me in?
Clark Kent (9 Years): The world’s too big, mom.
Martha Kent: Then make it smaller. Just um…focus on my voice.
[Clark closes his eyes as he listens to his mother’s voice]
Martha Kent: Pretend it’s an island, out in the ocean. Can you see it?
Clark Kent (9 Years): I see it.
Martha Kent: Then swim towards it, honey.
[Clark opens the door and embraces Martha]
Clark Kent (9 Years): What’s wrong with me, mom?
[Martha looks at him lovingly]
Martha Kent: Clark.
[back to Clark in the ocean, he opens his eyes and is surrounded by whales, later we see Clark, in his tattered pants, running into someone’s backyard and quickly stealing some clothes from the back of an open car]
[after grabbing some clothes, Clark walks into a small town and notices a school bus drive past him and he start having a flashback to when he was a teenager and he’s on a school bus going on a field trip when he starts getting mocked by another kid]
Teenage Pete Ross: Hey, ass wipe. What do you think? Did you see the game?
Lana Lang: Leave him alone, Pete.
Teenage Pete Ross: Oh, what are you? His girlfriend? I wanna hear what he has to say.
[Clark looks at Lana for a moment]
Teenage Pete Ross: Come on, dick splash.
[suddenly the bus gets a flat tire and the driver swerves off a bridge and into the lake, as the kids are almost drowning Clark gets out through the emergency exit and pushes the bus out of the water and onto the side of the lake, Lana looks back and notices Clark outside the bus, then Lana and the other kids watch as Clark goes back into the lake and rescues Pete]
[later, Pete’s mother, along with Pete, meet with the Kents to talk about how Clark had rescued her son]
Helen Ross: My son was there, he was in the bus. He saw what Clark did.
Jonathan Kent: I know he did. I’m sure…I’m sure what he thought he saw was…
Helen Ross: Was act of God, Jonathan. This was providence.
[Jonathan smiles uncomfortably and looks at Martha]
Martha Kent: Well, I think you’re blowing it a little out of the proportion.
Helen Ross: No, I’m not. Lana saw it too, and the Fordman boy. And this isn’t the first time Clark’s done something like this.
[Jonathan looks through the window into the backyard, where Clark was sitting on the garden swing, but he sees that Clark’s left]
[Jonathan leaves the house and finds Clark sitting on the back of the truck walks up to him]
Clark Kent (13 Years): I just wanted to help.
Jonathan Kent: I know you did, but we talked about this. Right? Right? We talked about this, you have…Clark, you have to keep this side of yourself a secret.
Clark Kent (13 Years): What was I supposed to do? Just let ’em die?
Jonathan Kent: Maybe. There’s more at stake here than just our lives, Clark, or the lives of those around us. When the world…when the world finds out what you can do, it’s going to change everything. Our…our beliefs, our notions of what it means to be human, everything. You saw how Pete’s mom reacted, right? She was scared, Clark.
Clark Kent (13 Years): Why?
Jonathan Kent: People are afraid of what they don’t understand.
Clark Kent (13 Years): Is she right? Did God do this to me?
[Jonathan doesn’t respond and just looks at Clark]
Clark Kent (13 Years): Tell me!
[Jonathan takes Clark to the barn and shows him the ship he was found in as a child]
Jonathan Kent: We found you in this. We were sure the government was gonna show up at our doorstep, but no one ever came.
[Jonathan takes out the key with ‘S’ logo on it that Jor-El had placed in the ship]
Jonathan Kent: This was in that chamber with you.
[he gives the key to Clark]
Jonathan Kent: I took it to a Metallurgist in Kansas state. He said, whatever it was made from didn’t even… didn’t even exist on the periodic table. It’s another way of saying that it’s not from this world, Clark. And neither are you. You’re the answer, son. You’re the answer to are we alone in the universe.
Clark Kent (13 Years): I don’t wanna be.
Jonathan Kent: And I don’t blame you, son. It’d be a huge burden for anyone to bare, but you’re not just anyone, Clark. And I have to believe that you were…that you were sent here for a reason. All these changes that you’re going through, one day…one day you’re gonna think of them as a blessing. And when that day comes, you’re gonna have to make a choice. A choice of whether to stand proud in front of the human race or not.
Clark Kent (13 Years): Can’t I just keep pretending I’m your son.
Jonathan Kent: You are my son.
[he embraces Clark]
Jonathan Kent: But somewhere out there you…you have another father too who gave you another name. And he sent you here for a reason, Clark. And even if it take you the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is.
[back to the present, we see Clark working in a bar when he overhears two army men talking about something being spotted in the Arctic]
Canadian Airman #1: I heard somebody found something strange on Ellesmere. Aircon’s been making runs out there all week.
Canadian Airman #2: That rat hole, you gotta be kidding me?
Canadian Airman #1: I know. It’s crazy, right? The Americans are there too. Lots of them. They’re calling it an anomalous object, whatever that means.
[at the same time Clark sees the waitress being harassed by a one of the bar patrons]
Chrissy: Back off, Ludlow. I’m serious.
Ludlow: Oh, come on, Chrissy.
[Ludlow pats her on the ass and she slaps his hand off]
Chrissy: Knock it off!
[Ludlow grabs her hand]
Ludlow: Sit down.
Chrissy: Let me go.
[at that moment Clark intervenes and puts his hand on Ludlow’s shoulder]
Clark Kent: Hey. Leave her alone, man.
[Ludlow rises in anger to face Clark]
Ludlow: Or what, tough guy?
Clark Kent: Or…gonna have to ask you to leave.
Ludlow: I think, I’ll probably just leave when I’m good and ready.
[he throws his beer onto Clark’s face and Clark just looks at him]
Ludlow: Ooh, there he is.
[Ludlow goes to push Clark, but Clark doesn’t move and it’s like he’s hit a rock, Clark makes a step toward Ludlow but the waitress stops him]
Chrissy: It’s not worth, sweetie.
[Clark takes his apron off and turns to leave]
Ludlow: Hey, asshole, don’t forget your tip.
[Ludlow throws a metal can at the back of Clark’s head, Clark ignore the jibe and walks out of the bar, later when Ludlow leaves the bar he sees his truck smashed between two power lines, then we see Clark hitching for a ride]
[in the Arctic, we see Clark working as crew for the army, he’s motioned to go meet the helicopter that’s just arrived with reporter Lois Lane, he helps her off the helicopter]
Lois Lane: Thanks.
[she turns to meet Jed Eubanks]
Lois Lane: Hi.
Jed Eubanks: Miss Lane, how are you doing? Jed Eubanks, Arctic cargo.
Lois Lane: How far to the station?
Jed Eubanks: Camp’s just over the rise, I’ll walk you over.
Lois Lane: Great.
[Eubanks points to Clark]
Jed Eubanks: Joe can take your bag.
[to Clark]
Jed Eubanks: Joe! Help her out.
[Clark takes Lois’s bags from the helicopter]
Lois Lane: Careful with those, they are heavy.
[Lois turns and starts walking off with Eubanks]
Jed Eubanks: I gotta confess Miss Lane, I’m not a fan of the Daily Planet. But those pieces you wrote when you were embedded with the First Division were…well, they were pretty impressive.
Lois Lane: Well, what can I say. I get writers block if I’m not wearing a flat jacket.
[at the army’s camp, Lois meets with Colonel Hardy and Dr. Emil Hamilton]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Miss, Lane! I’m Colonel Hardy U.S. Northcom. Dr. Emil Hamilton from DARPA
[Lois extends her hand to Hardy to shake but he ignores her]
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Hi.
[Hamilton shakes her hand]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: You’re early. We were excepting you tomorrow.
Lois Lane: Which is why I showed up today. Look, let’s get one thing straight, guys, okay? The only reason I’m here is because we’re on Canadian soil and the appellate court overruled your injunction to keep me away. So, if we’re done measuring dicks, can you have your people show me what you found?
[Hardy looks at Hamilton, who smiles]
[later Lois is being shown satellite images of the ship that was found in the Arctic]
Officer Sekowsky: NASA’s ER satellites pinged the anomaly first, the ice shelf plays hell on the echo soundings, but there’s definitely something down there.
Lois Lane: A submarine, maybe from Soviet era?
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Doubtful, that’s three hundred meters, considerably larger than anything we know they built back then.
Officer Sekowsky: But here’s the spooky part. The ice surrounding the object, it’s nearly twenty thousand years old.
[later Lois is outside the camp, looking around]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Miss Lane, try not wander. Temperatures drops to minus forty at night around here. We couldn’t find your body until after spring.
[as Hardy takes her to where she will be sleeping, we see Clark stepping out of the room]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: There you go.
Lois Lane: What if I need to tinkle?
Colonel Nathan Hardy: There’s a bucket in the corner.
[that night, Lois goes out exploring and taking pictures with her camera when she snaps a picture of Clark walking in the distance]
Lois Lane: Where the hell are you going?
[she follows Clark and enters a cave in the ice, we then see Clark using his heat vision to make way into the cave and finally finds a large spaceship, he enters the ship and finds one of the service levitating robots that allows him to place his ‘S’ key in it, but before he can, the second robot behind him lashes out at him and attacks him, Clark manages to fend it off and enter his key into the robot, after which the ghost of Jor-El appears and starts walking off]
Clark Kent: Hello?
[Clark starts following Jor-El’s ghost, meanwhile, Lois enters the ship and finds the Kryptonian service robot and takes a picture of it, this provokes it and causes it to attack her, Clark hears her and manages to grab the robot before it attacks Lois again and destroys it]
Clark Kent: It’s alright. It’s alright. It’s alright!
[Lois backs away from him in fear]
Clark Kent: It’s alright.
[he manages to grab hold of her and calm her, he then opens her jacket and sees that she’s been wounded]
Clark Kent: You’re hemorrhaging internally. Now if I don’t cauterize this bleed…
Lois Lane: Okay.
Clark Kent: I can do things that other people can’t. Hold my hand. This is gonna hurt.
[he then proceeds to use his heat vision to treat her Lois’s wound, making her scream out in pain]
[at the camp Hardy and his men hear a rumbling occurs near the base and they notice the ship rising to the sky and flying off]
Lois Lane: [voice over] While Colonel Hardy and his team surmised it was a Soviet era submarine, it was actually something much more exotic. An isotope analysis of the surrounding ice bores suggests that an object had been trapped in the glacier for over eighteen thousand years. As for my rescuer, he disappeared during the object’s departure. A background check revealed that his work history and identity had been falsified. The questions raised by my rescuers existence are frightening to contemplate, but I also know what I saw.
[we see Lois at the Daily Planet reading her story to her boss, Perry White]
Lois Lane: And I’ve arrived at inescapable conclusion, that the object and its occupant, did not originate on earth.
Perry White: I can’t print this, Lois. You might have hallucinated half of it.
Lois Lane: What about the civilian contractors who corroborated my story?
Perry White: The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.
Lois Lane: Of course they are, that’s what they’re supposed to do, it’s the Pentagon. Perry, come on, it’s me we’re talking about. I’m a Pulitzer prize winning reporter.
Perry White: Then act like it.
Lois Lane: Print it or I walk.
Perry White: You can’t, you’re under contract.
[Lois sighs in frustration]
Perry White: I’m not running a story about aliens walking among us.
[Perry sits behind his desk and looks at Lois]
Perry White: Never gonna happen.
[Lois smiles]
[later Lois meets with an internet blogger at a bar]
Ace O’ Clubs Bartender: That’s a scotch straight up for the lady.
[Lois emails her story via her cellphone]
Lois Lane: I’m sending you the original article. My editor won’t print it, but if it happened to leak online.
Glen Woodburn: Got it. But didn’t you once describe my site as a ‘creeping cancer of falsehoods’?
Lois Lane: I stand by my words, Woodburn. But I want this story out there.
Glen Woodburn: Why?
Lois Lane: Because I want my mystery man to know I know the truth.
[we see the ship, that Clark took, in a remote place in the Arctic; inside the ship Clark listens to the ship’s computer generated voice guidance]
Scoutship Voice Guidance: Recursive diagnostics complete. Guiding presence authenticated. All systems operational.
[suddenly a doorway behind Clark opens and behind it is Jor-El, he steps toward Clark]
Jor-El: To see you standing there and grown into an adult. If only Lara could have witnessed this.
Clark Kent: Who are you?
Jor-El: I am your father, Kal. Or at least a shadow of him, his conciousness. My name is Jor-El.
Clark Kent: And Kal? That’s my name?
Jor-El: Kal-El, it is.
Clark Kent: I have so many questions. Where do I come from? Why did you send me here?
Jor-El: You came from Krypton. A world with a much harsher environment than earth’s. Long ago, in era of expansion, our race spread out through the stars, seeking new worlds to settle upon. This scout ship was one of thousands launched into the void. We built outposts on other planets, using great machines to reshape environments to our needs. For one hundred thousand years our civilization flourished, accomplishing wonders.
Clark Kent: What happened?
Jor-El: Artificial population control was established. The outposts on space exploration were abandoned. We exhausted our natural resources, as a result our planets core became unstable. Eventually our military leader, General Zod, attempted a coup. But by then it was too late.
Jor-El: Your mother and I foresaw the coming calamity, and we took certain steps to ensure your survival.
[Jor-El show Clark a model of the Genesis Chamber]
Jor-El: This is a Genesis Chamber. All Kryptonians were conceived in chambers such as this. Every child was designed to fulfill a predetermined role in our society; as a worker, a warrior, a leader and so on. Your mother and I believed Krypton lost something precious, the element of choice, of chance. What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended for him or her? What if a child aspired to something greater? You were the embodiment of that belief, Kal, Krypton’s first natural birth in centuries. That’s why we risked so much to save you.
Clark Kent: Why didn’t you come with me?
Jor-El: We couldn’t, Kal. No matter how much we wanted to, no matter how much we loved you. Your mother Lara and I were a product of the failures of our world as much as Zod was. We were tied to its fate.
Clark Kent: So I’m alone.
Jor-El: No. You are as much a child of earth now as you are of Krypton. You can embody the best of both worlds. A dream your mother and I dedicated our lives to preserve.
[at that moment a chamber opens beside them and Superman’s iconic suit is revealed]
Jor-El: The people of earth are different than us, it’s true. But ultimately I believe that’s a good thing. They won’t necessarily make the same mistakes we did. Not if you guide them, Kal. Not if you give them hope. That’s what this symbol means.
[he opens his coat to reveal ‘S’ shape symbol on his suit]
Jor-El: The symbol of the house of EL means hope. Embodied within that hope is the fundamental belief in the potential of every person to be a force for good. That’s what you can bring them.
[Kal turns and looks at the suit]
[we see Clark in his suit leaving the ship and walking out into the icy mountain]
Clark Kent: [voice over] Why am I so different from them?
&Jor-El: [voice over] Earth’s sun is younger and brighter than Krypton’s was. Your cells have drunk in its radiation, strengthening your muscles, your skin, your senses. Earth’s gravity is weaker, yet its atmosphere is more nourishing. You’ve grown stronger here than I ever could imagine. The only way to know how strong is to keep testing your limits.
[we see Clark flying off testing his flight, but suddenly he loses balance and falls down, crashing into the icy mountain, he emerges from the mountain ruble and stands again]
Jor-El: [voice over] You will give the people of earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.
[Clark closes his eyes and raises his face toward the sun, then he takes off again and this time soars off across the planet with great speed and strength]
[Lois continues to search for Clark, tracking him and speaking to the people he’s come into contact with]
Lois Lane: [voice over] How do you find someone who has spent a lifetime covering his track? You start with the urban legends that have sprung up in his wake. All of the friends of the friend who claim to have seen him.
[we see Lois speaking to Jed Eubanks, then the waitress he’d helped in the bar]
Lois Lane: [voice over] For some he was a guardian angel. For others, a cypher, a ghost who never quite fit in.
[we see Lois talking to the fishermen he worked with on the boat, then the coast guards that had seen him help rescue the oil rig workers]
Lois Lane: [voice over] As you work your way back in time, the stories begin to form a pattern.
[Lois then tracks the adult Pete Ross at his work place]
Lois Lane: Pete Ross?
[he turns and looks at Lois]
Lois Lane: I’d like to talk to you about an accident that occurred when you were younger, a school bus that went in to the river?
[this leads Lois to the Kent farm and goes up to the house to meet Martha]
Lois Lane: Mrs. Kent?
[Martha nods her head]
Lois Lane: I’m Lois Lane. I’m from the Daily Planet. Um…
[Martha’s dog starts barking]
Martha Kent: Quite!
Lois Lane: I’m from the Daily Planet and I’d like to talk to you about your son.
[later Lois goes to a cemetery where Jonathan is buried, she suddenly feels Clark behind her]
Lois Lane: I figured if I turned over enough stones you’d eventually find me.
[she turns over and starts walking toward Clark]
Lois Lane: Where are you from? What are you doing here? Let me tell your story.
Clark Kent: What if I don’t want my story told?
Lois Lane: It’s going to come out eventually. Somebody’s gonna get a photograph or figure out where you live.
Clark Kent: Well then I’ll just disappear again.
Lois Lane: The only way you can disappear for good is to stop helping people all together, and I sense that’s not an option for you.
Clark Kent: My father believed that if the world found out who I really was, they’d reject me out of fear.
[we see another flashback to when Clark, a young man now, is arguing with Jonathan as Jonathan drives them home]
Clark Kent: I’m tired of safe! I just wanna do something useful with my life.
Jonathan Kent: So, farming, feeding people, that’s not…that’s not useful?
Clark Kent: I didn’t say that.
Jonathan Kent: Our family’s been farming for five generations, Clark.
Clark Kent: Your family, not mine. I don’t even know why I’m listening to you, you’re not my dad, you’re just some guy who found me in a field.
Martha Kent: Clark!
Jonathan Kent: That’s alight, Martha. He’s right, Clark has a point. We’re not your parents, but we’ve been doing the best we can and we have been making this up as we go along, so maybe…maybe our best isn’t good enough anymore.
Clark Kent: Look, dad…
[Jonathan spots something ahead]
Jonathan Kent: Hold on.
[Jonathan stops the car and they get out to look at the beginning of a tornado coming towards them, Martha also gets out of the car, leaving their dog in the back seat]
Jonathan Kent: Go for the overpass.
[Clark walks over to Martha]
Jonathan Kent: Go for the overpass!
[Clark takes his mother to the overpass and Jonathan directs the rest of the people gathering]
Jonathan Kent: Take cover! Take cover! Take cover!
[Jonathan goes over to help a woman trying to get her kid out of the car]
Young Mother: She’s stuck!
[Jonathan gets the little girl out of the car and helps her and her mother to go to the overpass]
[as they run toward the overpass; referring to their dog]
Martha Kent: Hank’s in the car! Hank’s in the car.
[Clark runs over to Jonathan, who’s holding the little girl he’s rescued from the car]
Clark Kent: I’ll get him, I’ll get him.
Jonathan Kent: No. No. Get your mom to the overpass.
[Jonathan hands the little girl to Clark and Clark takes her and Martha safely to the overpass, Jonathan runs over to their car to get their dog, but the tornado closes in and a flying car lands on Jonathan’s car, he manages to get the dog out safely but gets his foot stuck in the car, as the tornado gets closer, Jonathan gets his foot free and he falls out of the car]
Martha Kent: Jonathan!
Clark Kent: Mom, stay here.
[Jonathan tries to walk but he’s injured foot makes it impossible, Clark goes to rescue him but Jonathan holds his hand out for him to stop and shakes his head, he smiles at Clark as he allows himself to get taken by the tornado, and Clark screams in sorrow]
Clark Kent: I let my father die because I trusted him. Because he was convinced that I had to wait, that the world was not ready.
[he pauses for a moment as Lois looks at him]
Clark Kent: What do you think?
[Lois enters the Daily Planet and makes her way to her desk]
Weaver: You better watch out, Lois.
Steve Lombard: Hey, Perry’s gunnin’ for you, He knows you’re Woodburn’s anonymous source and he cannot wait to rip you into one.
[Lois walks over to Perry’s office and enters, closing the door behind her]
Perry White: I told you not to run with this, and what do you do? You let Woodburn just shotgun it all over the internet. Now, the publishers want me to sue you.
Lois Lane: Well, if it makes a difference, I’m dropping it.
Perry White: Woh. Just like that?
Lois Lane: Yeah.
Perry White: What happened to your leads?
Lois Lane: They didn’t pan out, the story is smoke.
Perry White: Or perhaps it just didn’t get the attraction that you hoped it would. Two weeks leave, no pay, that’s your penance. You try something like this again, you’re done here.
Lois Lane: Fine.
[Lois turns and starts to walk out of the office]
Perry White: No, let’s make it three weeks, since you’re so willing to agree with me.
Lois Lane: Perry!
Perry White: No, no. Don’t. I believe you saw something, Lois, but not for a moment do I believe that your leads just went cold. So whatever your reasons are for dropping it, I think you’re doing the right thing.
Lois Lane: Why?
Perry White: Can you imagine how people on this planet would react, if…they knew there was someone like this out there?
[on the Kent farm, as Martha work in the garden she notices Clark walking toward the house in the distance, the dog barks and runs toward Clark]
Martha Kent: Go get him!
[Clark pats the dog and walks towards Martha]
Martha Kent: Well look at you!
[Clark and Martha embrace and walk toward the house]
Martha Kent: A reporter came by here.
Clark Kent: She’s a friend, don’t worry.
Martha Kent: Oh.
Clark Kent: Mom.
Martha Kent: What?
Clark Kent: I found them.
Martha Kent: Who?
Clark Kent: My parents, my people. I know where I come from now.
[Martha looks happy and sad at the same time]
Martha Kent: Wow…that’s wonderful. I’m so happy for you, Clark.
[Martha looks sad as she turns from Clark and stands on the porch steps]
Clark Kent: What?
Martha Kent: It’s nothing.
[they both sit on the porch steps]
Martha Kent: When you were a baby I used to lay by your crib at night, listening to you breathe. It was hard for you, you struggled and I worried all the time.
Clark Kent: You worried the truth would come out.
Martha Kent: No. The truth about you? You were beautiful, we saw that the moment we laid eyes on you. We knew that one day, the whole world would see that. I’m just…I’m worried they’ll take you away from me.
[as Martha starts to cry, Clark holds her and comforts her]
Clark Kent: I’m not going anywhere, mom. I promise.
[General Swanwick enters NORAD/US Northcom Command Center]
Dr. Emil Hamilton: General Swanwick, sir.
General Swanwick: What am I looking at, doc. Comet? Asteroid?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Comets don’t make course corrections, General. I wanted you to see this before some amateur with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.
[he show Swanwick images of a spaceship that has been spotted]
Dr. Emil Hamilton: The ship appears to have inserted itself into a lunar synchronous orbit, though I have no idea why.
General Swanwick: Have you tried…communicating with it?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Well, they haven’t responded as of yet.
General Swanwick: I’m just speculating, but I think whoever is at the helm of that thing is looking to make a dramatic entrance.
[at the Daily Planet, Lois is having problems with the photocopying machine]
Lois Lane: Does anybody know where we keep the toner cartridges?
[she looks up to see everyone in the office walking toward the TV screens their office]
Lois Lane: What’s going on?
Jenny: It’s all over the news. You’ve gotta see this.[Lois joins everyone else as they look at the news footage of a UFO being sighted; back at the Kent farm, Clark is in the kitchen watching football when Martha calls out to him after spotting the UFO in the sky]
Martha Kent: Clark.
Clark Kent: Yeah, coming.
[Clark joins Martha outside and they look up to see the spaceship in the sky; back at the Daily Planet as everyone is watching the news suddenly the lights go out and the news is interrupted with a transmission]
[on the Kent farm, Clark enters the house as he hears the message]
General Zod: You are not alone. You…are not…alone. You are not alone. You…are…not… alone.
[we see the same message being repeated and broadcast all over the world in different languages before going back to the Daily Planet]
Jenny: It’s coming in on the RSS feeds. It’s on my phone too.
[suddenly the transmission changes and starts showing shadows of Zod on the screen]
General Zod: My name is General Zod. I come from a world far from yours. I have journeyed across an ocean of stars to reach you. For some time your world has sheltered one of my citizens. I request that you return this individual to my custody. For reasons unknown he has chosen to keep his existence a secret from you. He will have made efforts to blend in. He will look like you, but he is not one of you.
[as he hears this message Clark turns to look at Martha]
General Zod: To those of you who may know of his current location, the fate of your planet rests in your hands. To Kal-El, I say this. Surrender within twenty-four hours, or watch this world suffer the consequences.
[suddenly the message ends and all the lights are turned back on making Martha jump in terror, Clark embraces her as he comforts her]
[the next morning, as Lois is getting ready to go to work she watches the news showing Woodburn being interviewed]
News Show Host: We hardly know anything about him, isn’t that right?
Glen Woodburn: If he truly means us no harm, then he’ll turn himself into his people and face the consequences. And if he won’t do that, then maybe we should. Uh…The Daily Planet’s Lois Lane knows who this guys is, and I think that she’s the one that we should be questioning.
[at that moment Lois gets a call from Perry]
News Show Host: Hold on. You’re saying, Lois Lane, the Pulitzer prize winner, knows who this guy is?
[Lois answer the call from Perry]
Lois Lane: Hello?
Perry White: Are you watching this crap? It’s been running all morning. For once I actually agree with Woodburn. Now have you seen him? Do you know where he is?
Lois Lane: No. And even if I did, I wouldn’t say.
Perry White: The entire world is being threatened here. This is not the time for you to fall back on your journalistic integrity.
[as Lois looks out her apartment window she notices several official cars pulling up outside her apartment building and sees FBI official getting out of the cars]
Perry White: This is serious, Lois. The FBI is here. They’re throwing around words like treason.
Lois Lane: I gotta go.
[Lois runs out of her apartment and just misses the FBI coming up to her apartment floor, she runs out of her building and goes through an alleyway to avoid being seen but at the end of the road an FBI car pulls up on front of her and stops her]
FBI Agent: FBI! Hands up! Drop the bag, now!
[Lois drops her back and holds her hands up as she’s being held at gun point by three FBI soldiers]
[back in Smallville, Clark enters a church and hears the priest listening to the news on the radio talking about the visitors and Clark]
Radio Show Host: Regarding the visitors, we know very little at this point. According to government officials I’ve spoken to, the visitors do not represent a threat, despite the ominous tone of their message. Then of course, there’s the question on everyone’s mind, who is this Kal-El person? Does he actually exist? How could he remain hidden from us for so long?

[as Clark listens to this, he has another flashback, remembering when several bullies come upon Clark as he’s sat in his father’s truck reading]
Roughneck: Come on, Kent.
[he drags Clark out of the truck and pushes him against a fence]
Roughneck: Come on, fight back! Get up, Kent.
[he pulls his fist up as if he’s going to hit Clark, but Clark just stares at him]
Roughneck: So, is that it? Is that all you’ve got?
[Clark continues to stare at him as he continues to taunt him]
Roughneck: Come on, Kent. Come on!
[he’s stopped by his friend, they turn to see Jonathan standing behind them, the bullies leave, then Clark looks up and sees Pete Ross offering him a hand up, which he takes, as Clark rises we see the dent his hand has left in the iron pole near the fence he was holding onto]
Jonathan Kent: Did they hurt you?
Clark Kent (13 Years): You know they can’t.
Jonathan Kent: That’s not what I meant. I meant, are you alright?
Clark Kent (13 Years): I wanted to hit that kid, I wanted to hit him so bad.
Jonathan Kent: I know you did. I mean, part of me even wanted you to, but then what? Make you feel any better?
[there’s a moment’s pause as Clark looks at Jonathan]
Jonathan Kent: You just have to decide what kind of man you wanna grow up to be, Clark. Because, whoever that man is, good character or bad, he’s…he’s gonna change the world.
[back to the Church in Smallville, Clark sits on one of the pews]
Father Leone: What’s on your mind?
Clark Kent: I don’t know where to start.
Father Leone: Wherever you want.
Clark Kent: That ship that appeared last night, I’m the one they’re looking for.
[the priest swallows nervously as he looks at Clark]
Father Leone: Do you know why they want you?
Clark Kent: No. But this General Zod, even if I surrender, there’s no guarantee he’ll keep his word. But, if there’s a chance I can save earth by turning myself in, shouldn’t I take it?
Father Leone: What does your gut tell you?
Clark Kent: Zod can’t be trusted. The problem is, I’m not sure the people of earth can be either.
[Clark rises and starts walking out of the church]
Father Leone: Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first, the trust part comes later.
[Clark stops and looks back at the priest]
[at the army base, Clark, now dressed in his suit, flies in to turn himself in, all guns are pointed at him as he hovers above the base]
General Swanwick: Alright, you’ve got our attention. What is it you want?
Clark Kent: I would like to speak to Lois Lane.
General Swanwick: What makes you think she’s here?
Clark Kent: Don’t play games with me, General. I’ll surrender, but only if you’ll guarantee Lois’s freedom.
[Clark is then taken in handcuffs to meet with Lois in the interrogation room]
Lois Lane: Why are you surrendering to Zod?
Clark Kent: I’m surrendering to mankind, there’s a difference.
Lois Lane: You let them handcuff you?
Clark Kent: Wouldn’t be much of a surrender if I resisted. And if it makes them feel more secure, then… then all the better for it.
[looking at Clark’s suit]
Lois Lane: What’s the ‘S’ stand for?
[Clark smiles]
Clark Kent: It’s not an ‘S’. On my world it means ‘hope’.
Lois Lane: Well, here it’s an ‘S’. How about…Sup…
[at that moment they’re interrupted by the sound of a microphone]
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Uh, sir. Hi. Uh, my name is Dr…
[Clark looks over to two-way mirror, behind which Hamilton, Hardy, Swanwick and other army officials are watching Clark and Lois in the interrogation room]
Clark Kent: Emil Hamilton, I know. I can see your ID tag in your breast pocket, along with a half eaten roll of Wint-O-Green Life Savers. I can also see the squad of soldiers in the next room, preparing that tranquillizing agent of yours. You won’t need it.
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Sir, you…you can’t expect us to not take precautions. You could be carrying some kind of alien pathogen.
Clark Kent: I’ve been here for thirty-three years, doctor, haven’t infected anyone yet.
General Swanwick: That you know of. We have legitimate security concerns. Now, you’ve revealed your identity to Miss Lane over there. Why don’t you do the same with us?
Clark Kent: Let’s put our cards on the table, General.
[Clark rises, easily breaking his handcuffs as he pulls his hands apart, and starts walking toward the two-way mirror]
Clark Kent: You’re scared of me because you can’t control me. You don’t, and you never will, but that doesn’t mean I’m your enemy.
General Swanwick: Then who is? Zod?
Clark Kent: That’s what I’m worried about.
General Swanwick: Be that as it may, I’ve been given orders to hand you over to him.
Clark Kent: Do what you have to do, General.

[Clark and Lois stand facing each other as they wait for Zod’s ship to arrive]
Clark Kent: Thank you.
Lois Lane: For what?
Clark Kent: For believing in me.
Lois Lane: Didn’t make much difference in the end.
Clark Kent: It did to me.
[Lois takes Clark’s hand and they stare at each other for a moment when they hear a noise]
Clark Kent: They’re coming. You should leave now.
[Lois remains]
Clark Kent: Go, Lois.
[Lois turns and leaves and walks back to the army base, where they all wait, with weapons pointed, for Zod’s arrival]
[as Zod’s ship arrives, Clark watches Faora-Ul leave the ship and walk toward him]
Faora-Ul: Kal-El, I’m sub commander Faora-Ul. On behalf of General Zod, I extend you his greetings.
[she walks over to Swanwick]
Faora-Ul: Are you the ranking officer here?
General Swanwick: I am.
Faora-Ul: General Zod would like this woman to accompany me.
[she points to Lois, who’s standing behind Swanwick and Hardy]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: You asked for the alien, you didn’t say anything about one of our own.
Faora-Ul: Shall I tell the General you’re unwilling to comply?
Colonel Nathan Hardy: I don’t care what you tell him.
[there’s a moment’s pause as Faora-Ul and Hardy stare at each other]
Lois Lane: It’s alright, I’ll go.
[Lois leaves with Faora-Ul, and along with Clark they enter the ship which quickly takes off as the army watches]
[as Lois and Clark enter the ship, as Faora-Ul leaves for a moment, Clark hands over his ‘S’ key to Lois to keep; Faora-Ul returns, holding a helmet in her hand]
Faora-Ul: The atmosphere composition in our ship is not compatible with humans. You will need to wear a breather beyond this point.
[she places the helmet on Lois’s head; then we see the ship entering Zod’s main larger ship where Clark and Lois are taken to Zod]
General Zod: Kal-El. You have no idea how long we’ve been searching for you.
Clark Kent: I take it you’re Zod.
Faora-Ul: General Zod, our Commander!
General Zod: It’s alright, Faora-Ul. You can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum. He’s a stranger to our ways. This should be cause for celebration, not conflict.
[we see Kal starting to feel strange, the atmosphere of the ship affecting him]
Clark Kent: I…feel strange. Weak.
[Kal collapses to the ground and starts spitting up blood]
Lois Lane: What’s happening to him?
General Zod: He’s rejecting our ships atmospherics.
Lois Lane: Clark…
General Zod: You’ve spent a lifetime adapting to earth’s ecology but you never adapted to ours.
[Lois kneels beside Clark, looking concerned]
Lois Lane: Help him!
General Zod: I can’t. Whatever’s happening to him has to run its course.
[Clark looks visibly weaker as he lies on the ground]
Lois Lane: Clark! Help him! Help him!
[Clark passes out]
[as Clark passes on Zod’s ship, we seek him wake up in his normal clothes outside his family farm, which is being projected by Zod]
General Zod: Hello, Kal. Or do you prefer Clark? That’s the name they gave you, isn’t it?
[Clark rises, looking around him, confused]
General Zod: I was Krypton’s military leader, your father our foremost scientist. The only thing we agreed on was that Krypton was dying. In return for my efforts to protect our civilization, and save our planet, I and my fellow officers were sentenced to the Phantom Zone. And then the destruction of our world freed us. We were adrift, destined to float amongst the ruins of our planet until we starved.
Clark Kent: How did you find your way to earth?
General Zod: We managed to retro fit the phantom projector into our hyper drive. Your father made a similar modification to the craft that brought your here. And so the instrument of our damnation became our salvation. We sought out the old colonial outposts, looking for signs of life. But all we found was death. Cut off from Krypton these outpost withered and died long ago. We salvaged what we could, armor, weapons, even a world engine. For thirty-three years we prepared, until finally we detected a distress beacon, which you triggered when you accessed the ancient scout ship.
General Zod: You lead us here, Kal. And now it’s within your power to save what remains of your race. On Krypton, the genetic template of every being yet to be born is encoded in the registry of citizens. Your father stole the registry’s codex and stored in the capsule that brought you here.
Clark Kent: For what purpose?
General Zod: So that Krypton can live again…on earth.
[as they stand on Clark’s family farm, Zod projects the farm being destroyed, then we see Clark standing in his suit in the remains of ruined farm]
General Zod: Where is the codex, Kal?
Clark Kent: If Krypton lives again, what happens to earth?
General Zod: A foundation has to be built on something. Even your father recognized that.
[the ground beneath Clark’s feet starts to move, he looks down to see that he’s standing on thousands of human skulls]
Clark Kent: No. Zod, I can’t be a part of this.
General Zod: Then what can you be a part of?
[Clark starts slowly sinking into the sea of human skulls]
Clark Kent: No! Stop! No! No!
[as Clark fully sinks in the sea of human skulls, he suddenly wakes up and finds himself back on Zod’s ship, tied down to metal slab, he tries to free himself but he’s too weak, he sees Zod standing beside him]
General Zod: Your father acquitted himself with honor, Kal.
Clark Kent: You killed him?
General Zod: I did. And not a day goes by when it doesn’t haunt me. But if I had to do it again, I would. I have a duty to my people, and I will not allow anyone to prevent me from carrying it out.
[Zod turns and leaves Clark tied to the metal slab]
[we see 2 ships leaving Zod’s main ship; back at US Northcom Command Center]
General Swanwick: What’s the signal, Major?
Major Laramore: DSP is pinging two bogeys launching from the alien ship.
[to his colleague]
Major Laramore: Put it out.
Northcom Threat Analyst #1: Yes, sir.
[they see the two ships signal on the large monitor]
Major Laramore: There it is.
General Swanwick: Re-task ICOM four, get me a closer look.
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: Yes, sir.
[Swanwick makes a call]
General Swanwick: Command, the word of the day is trident. We have two alien craft on aggressive approach.
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: ICOM four coming online.
General Swanwick: Air speed?
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: Three hundred and eighty knots and entering Kansas airspace, they’re not responding to our hails.
[back on Zod’s ship as Clark struggles to free himself from his ties]
Jax-Ur: You’re wasting your efforts. The strength you derived from your exposure to the earth’s sun has been neutralized on our ship. Here, in this environment, you’re as weak as a human.
[Jax-Ur sticks a large needle into Clark and extracts some of his blood, meanwhile, Lois is taken into another part of the ship and thrown into a chamber, she looks around and finds a mainframe, she inserts the ‘S’ key into it then turns to find Jor-El standing behind her]
Lois Lane: Where did you come from?
Jor-El: The command key, Miss Lane. Thanks to you, I’m uploading into the ships mainframe.
Lois Lane: Who are you?
Jor-El: I’m Kal’s father.
Lois Lane: Can you help us?
Jor-El: I designed this ship, I can modify its atmospheric composition to human compatibility. We can stop them, we can send them back to the Phantom Zone.
Lois Lane: How?
Jor-El: I can teach you. And in return you can teach Kal. Will you help me?
[after Jor-El changes the ship’s atmosphere to human compatibility, Lois is able to take off her helmet]
Jor-El: The ship’s crew are alerted, we need to move quickly. Retrieve the command key.
[Lois takes the key out of the mainframe, Jor-El then opens the chamber door and as they leave the chamber they are met by one of Zod’s officers, Jor-El uses his power to stop her from shooting at them]
Lois Lane: Did you do that?
Jor-El: Yes. Pick up her side-arm.
[Lois takes the fallen officer’s weapon and follows Jor-El; as the atmosphere in the ship has changed, Clark now finds his strength returned]
Lois Lane: What’s happening?
[he manages to break his bonds and Jax-Ur feeling weak, manages to leave the chamber; we see Jor-El guiding Lois around the ship]
Jor-El: To you right, fire.
[as they come across an intersection, Lois uses her weapon to fire to the right, shooting another one of Zod’s officers]
Jor-El: Behind you.
[Lois quickly turns and shoots at another officer coming up from behind, then Jor-El uses his power to close the chamber door on more officers approaching]
[Jor-El then leads Lois to where the ship’s pods are kept]
Jor-El: Secure yourself inside the under pod. Safe travels, Miss Lane. It’s highly unlikely we’ll be seeing each other again.
[Lois gets inside the pod]
Jor-El: Remember, the Phantom drives are essential in stopping them. Move your head to the left.
[Lois looks at Jor-El in confusion, then suddenly Faora-Ul runs up from behind Jor-El, who disappears, and attacks Lois shooting at the pod, Lois manages to close the pod and launch out of Zod’s ship, but as pod is damaged it starts to plummet to earth]
[Clark manages to free himself from his ties and turns to find Jor-El standing behind him]
Clark Kent: Is it true what Zod said about the codex?
Jor-El: Strike that panel.
[Clark strikes the panel and breaks open the wall of the ship]
Jor-El: We wanted you to learn what it meant to be human first so that one day, when the time was right, you could be the bridge between two peoples.
[Jor-El looks out toward earth]
Jor-El: Look.
[Clark looks out and sees Lois’s pod as it quickly descends to earth]
Clark Kent: Lois.
Jor-El: You can save her, Kal. You can save all of them.
[Kal floats out of the broken panel then turns and flies off to save Lois, he manages to catch the pod and grab Lois out of the burning pod before it crashes to the ground]
[Clark brings Lois safely to the ground in the middle of a field]
Clark Kent: You’ll be safe here. Are you alright?
Lois Lane: Oh, yeah.
[she looks at Clark as he continues to hold her]
Lois Lane: I’m sorry. I didn’t wanna tell them anything about you, but they did something to me. They looked inside my mind…
Clark Kent: It’s okay, Lois. They did the same thing to me.
[they look at each other for a moment, but Clark senses something and suddenly flies off leaving Lois standing the field]
Lois Lane: Clark!
[Lois then hears sees a police car approaching and signals to them]
[Zod goes to the Kent farm to interrogate Martha about the codex]
General Zod: The craft he arrived in, where is it?
Martha Kent: Go to hell.
[Zod looks at Faora-Ul, who walks up to Martha and grabs her by the throat, holding her up high with one hand, as Martha starts to choke she looks over to the barn]
General Zod: There.
[Faora-Ul throws Martha to the ground, flies over to the barn, looks inside the ship but finds nothing and she flies back to Zod]
Faora-Ul: The codex is not here.
[on hearing this, Zod picks up Martha’s truck in anger and throws it at the house, destroying the side of the house]
General Zod: Where has he hidden it?
Martha Kent: I don’t know.
General Zod: Where is the codex?!
[at that moment Clark flies in and attacks Zod for trying to threaten Martha]
Clark Kent: You think you can threaten my mother!
[as they fly, Clark repeatedly punches Zod, they finally crash through a petrol station, causing a massive explosion, as Zod rises from the ground he finds his helmet is damaged and no longer working, his heightened senses start to overwhelm him as it had done when Clark was a child]
General Zod: What have you done to me?
Clark Kent: My parents taught me to hone my senses, Zod. To focus on just what I wanted to see. Without your helmet you’re getting everything. And it hurts, doesn’t it?
[at that moment, one of Zod’s smaller ships come down and shoot Clark aside, two of Zod’s men come and help him up and climb onto his ship and fly off]
[as Zod’s ship flies off, Clark turns to find Faora-Ul and another Kryptonian named Dev-Em, standing in the distance, Clark starts walking towards them and warning the people around]
Clark Kent: Get inside, it’s not safe.
[we then see the military flying in]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: All clear, this is Guardian. I am airborne mission commander. I have previously encountered and observed the beings we are about to engage in close proximity. They are extremely dangerous and we have been authorize to use deadly force.

A-10 Pilot #1: Roger, Guardian. We are inbound to target.
[as Clark Faora-Ul and Dev-Em are about to start fighting the military flies in and start shooting at them]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Thunder one-one, good hit. Request immediate re attack.
A-10 Pilot #1: Roger, Guardian. We’re commencing our run at 2-1-2 degrees.
[suddenly Dev-Em hurls himself at the military aircraft that’s about to shoot at them]
A-10 Pilot #1: Thunder one-one! Eject! Eject! Thunder one-one, eject!
[Dev-Em takes the aircraft down which crashes to the ground, then Faora-Ul flies towards another military aircraft]
A-10 Pilot #2: I have a bogey incoming!
[the pilot shoots at Faora-Ul which doesn’t affect he, she quickly advances towards the plane]
A-10 Pilot #2: Oh, shit!
[as she’s about to take the aircraft down, Clark flies in and grabs her and flies off with her]
[Clark and Faora-Ul crash into an IHOP restaurant, where Peter Ross works, Clark and Peter look at each other for a moment before Faora-Ul attacks Clark]
Faora-Ul: You are weak, son of El. Unsure of yourself.
[Clark attacks her but she easily hits back and throws him aside]
Faora-Ul: The fact that you possess a sense of morality and we do not, gives us an evolutionary advantage.
[Clark flies in to attack her, but again she defeats him but grabbing him by the throat and throwing him down]
Faora-Ul: And if history has proven anything…
[she picks Clark up and throws him across, crashing into the next building, she flies in and stands in front of Clark]
Faora-Ul: …it is that the evolution always wins.
[Clark attacks her and as they crash outside, Dev-Em joins them and attacks Clark, throwing him aside]
[Clark continues to fight with Faora-Ul and Dev-Em, as they try to overpower him he manages to use his heat vision to help him fight them off, at the same time the military have landed and are making their way toward them]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Bull Rangers, I need you to engage the targets.
(Military Soldier: Guardian, this is battle 01. What about that guy in blue?

Colonel Nathan Hardy: I said engage all the targets.
[two choppers fly in and start shooting at Clark, Faora-Ul and Dev-Em]
[we see Clark get hit, then Dev-Em picks up a truck and throw it at one of the choppers which hits another chopper, making the pilot fall out of the chopper, Clark sees the pilot falling and flies in to grab him and save him]
Clark Kent: You okay?
[as the pilot is about to answer they get attacked by Dev-Em, who throws Clark aside; at the same time Hardy’s chopper which was hit earlier is about to crash]
Chopper Pilot: We’re going in hard! Break for impact! Break for impact! We’re going in hard!
[as Faora-Ul watches, the chopper finally crashes to the ground]
Chopper Pilot: Guardian is down, I repeat, Guardian is down.
[the soldiers on ground start shooting at Faora-Ul, but the bullets have no impact on her and she easily takes them down, at the same time Clark and Dev-Em are battling it out]
[after Hardy’s chopper has gown down]
Little Bird Gunship Pilot: Guardian, do you read? Thunder one-two calling Guardian. Guardian do you read.
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Thunder one-two, this is Guardian. I want you to put down everything you’ve got, put bullets at my position, this is danger close.
Little Bird Gunship Pilot: Copy, danger close. Good luck, sir.
[Hardy starts shooting at Faora-Ul until his bullets run out, but remains standing with the bullets having no impact on her; at the same time Clark manages to throw Dev-Em onto a stationary train]
[then back with Hardy, he rises and draws his knife, Faora-Ul takes her knife out]
Faora-Ul: A good death has its own reward.
[just as she’s about to attack Hardy, Clark flies in and stops her, she faces Clark]
Faora-Ul: You will not win. For every human you save, we will kill a million more.
[at that moment Dev-Em flies in with the train and smashes it near where Clark is standing destroying everything around it as it explodes, then the military gunship flies in and launches a rocket toward Faora-Ul, she tries to deflect the rocket but it explodes around her, then one of Zod’s ship flies in and destroys the gunship, Dev-Em finds Faora-Ul unconscious and carries her onto their ship before it flies off]
[after the departure of Faora-Ul and Dev-Em, the military on ground move to where Clark had been thrown in the destruction caused by Dev-Em]
Communications Officer: Do we have an all clear? Do we have an all clear? Alpha Team, do you copy?
[as the military move in closer, Clark comes out from behind the wreckage and walks slowly toward them, he sees Hardy, they look at each other for a moment]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: This man is not our enemy.
Clark Kent: Thank you, Colonel.
[as Clark and Hardy come to an unspoken understanding, Clark suddenly flies off]
[inside the wreckage of the Kent house, Martha finds a photo album, as she looks at old photos of Clark as a kid, she hears Clark calling out to her]
Clark Kent: Mom?
Martha Kent: I’m alright!
[she walks up to Clark and they embrace]
Martha Kent: Nice suit, son.
Clark Kent: I’m so sorry.
Martha Kent: It’s only stuff, Clark. It can always be replaced.
Clark Kent: But you can’t be. Mom, Zod said this codex he’s looking for can actually bring my people back.
Martha Kent: Isn’t that a good thing?
Clark Kent: I don’t think they’re interested in sharing this world.
[at that moment Lois interrupts them as she gets dropped off by a police car]
Lois Lane: Clark! Clark, I know how to stop them.
[back on Zod’s main ship]
Jax-Ur: What happened down there?
General Zod: He exposed a temporary weakness.
Jax-Ur: It is of little consequence, because I have located the codex. It was never in the capsule. Jor-El took the codex, the DNA of a billion people, and he bonded it within his son’s individual cells. All of Krypton’s heirs, living, hidden in one refugee’s body.
General Zod: Does Kal-El need to be alive for us to extract the codex from his cells?
Jax-Ur: No.
General Zod: Release the world engine.
[we see the world engine being released from the ship and being sent to earth]
[at US Northcom Command Center]
General Swanwick: What just happened?
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: The ships just split in two. Track one is heading East, track two is deploying towards the Southern Hemisphere.
Major Laramore: How fast is that bogey moving?
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: Approaching mark twenty-four and accelerating. It looks like it’s gonna impact somewhere in South Indian Ocean.
[we see the world engine landing somewhere in the Indian Ocean]
Northcom Threat Analyst #1: The rest of the ship is descending.
Major Laramore: Put it on the board now.
Northcom Threat Analyst #1: Yes, sir.
[as they see Zod’s ship is heading towards Metropolis]
Major Laramore: Oh, my God.
[in Metropolis, everyone comes to a standstill as they notice Zod’s ship hovering above them in the sky]
General Zod: Bring the Phantom drive online.
[we see the world engine initiating]
Jax-Ur: We are now slave to the world engine.
General Zod: Initiate it.
[we see the world engine recreating the Kryptonian atmosphere which starts to cause mass destruction in Metropolis; back at US Northcom Command Center they watch on their monitors]
General Swanwick: What have they hit us with?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Looks like some kind of gravity weapon, it’s working in tandem with their ship. Somehow they’re increasing the earth’s mass, clouding the atmosphere with particulates. Oh, my God.
[he looks over at Swanwick]
Dr. Emil Hamilton: They’re terraforming.
Major Carrie Farris: What’s that?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Planetary engineering, modifying the earth’s atmosphere and topography.
General Swanwick: They’re turning earth in to Krypton.
Major Carrie Farris: But what happens to us?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Based on these readings, there won’t be an us.
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: General Swanwick, sir. I’m on with the control tower. Colonel Hardy’s on his way in and he’s got Superman in tow.
General Swanwick: Superman?
Northcom Threat Analyst #2: The alien, sir. That…that’s what they’re calling him, Superman.
[Lois, Clark and Hardy meet with Swanwick as a helicopter brings in the old ship that Clark was sent to earth in]
Lois Lane: We have a plan, General.
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Is that what I think it is?
Lois Lane: It’s the ship he arrived in.
Clark Kent: This ship is run by something called a Phantom drive, it bends space. Zod’s ship uses the same technology and if we can make the two drives collide with one other…
Dr. Emil Hamilton: A singularity can be created.
General Swanwick: Like a black hole?
Clark Kent: Yes. So if we open up this doorway, then theoretically they should be pulled back in.
Dr. Emil Hamilton: So, you…you want us bomb them with that?
Colonel Nathan Hardy: General, if that craft maxes out seventeen thousand pounds, we can drop it from a C-17. It’s a viable plan.
Clark Kent: And if I don’t stop that machine over the Indian Ocean, the gravity field will continue to expand.
[Swanwick hesitates for a moment before reluctantly nodding his head to agree to the plan, Clark turns and gets ready to fly off to the Indian Ocean]
Lois Lane: If that thing is making earth more like Krypton, won’t you be weaker around it?
Clark Kent: Maybe, I’m not about to let that stop me from trying. You might want to step back a little bit.
[Lois takes a few steps back]
Clark Kent: Maybe a little bit more.
[Lois smiles and takes a few more steps back then Clark takes off]
[back on Zod’s ship as it continues to destroy Metropolis as it terraforms]
General Zod: Faora, take command.
Faora-Ul: Yes, sir.
General Zod: I need to secure the Genesis Chamber and pay my respects to an old friend.
[at the same time, Hardy, accompanied by Lois and Hamilton, takes off in one of the C-17 aircrafts]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Guardian en route to Metropolis. Package in tow.
[Zod then finds the scout ship that Clark had placed on in the Arctic, he enters the ship and places a command key into the mainframe]
Scoutship Voice Guidance: Command key accepted. Genesis Chamber coming online, sir.
[Jor-El appears behind Zod]
Jor-El: Stop this, Zod, while there’s still time.
General Zod: Haven’t given up lecturing me, have you, even in death.
Jor-El: I will not let you use the codex like this.
General Zod: You don’t have the power to stop me. The command key I’ve entered is revoking your authority. This ship is now under my control.
[we see Clark flying towards the world engine in the Indian Ocean and Hardy’s C-17 aircrafts to Zod’s main ship in Metropolis]
C-17 Pilot: North Com, Lightning 1. Request permission to unleash the hounds.
General Swanwick: North Com, Lightning 1, you are clear to engage. Send battle damage assessment when able, out.
[the C-17’s start launching missiles at Zod’s ship over Metropolis]
C-17 Pilot: Avionics are going haywire. The gravity field is pulling our missiles down, we gotta get closer!
[at the Daily Planet as the city is being destroyed]
Perry White: Alright everybody, we are leaving. We’re leaving the building now!
[at the same time, Clark gets attacked by the world engine as he’s vulnerable to it; in Metropolis as Zod’s ship is destroying everything, Perry, Steve and Jenny run from the chaos]
[on the scoutship]
Jor-El: Our people can co-exist.
General Zod: So we can suffer through years of pain trying to adapt, like your son has?
Jor-El: You’re talking about genocide.
General Zod: Yes. And I’m arguing its merits with a ghost.
Jor-El: We’re both ghosts, Zod. Can’t you see that? The Krypton you’re clinging on to is gone!
General Zod: Ship, have you managed to quarantine this invasive intelligence?
Jor-El: Fail.
Scoutship Voice Guidance: I have.
General Zod: Then prepare to terminate it, I’m tired of this debate.
Jor-El: Silencing me won’t change anything. My son is twice the man you were, and he will finish what we started. I can promise you that.
[Zod turns to face Jor-El]
General Zod: Tell me, you have Jor-El’s memories, his conscience. Can you experience his pain? I will harvest the codex from your son’s corps. And I will rebuild Krypton, on top of his bones.
[Zod then punches his command key to fully insert it into the mainframe which makes Jor-El disappear, the scoutship then takes off]
[as Clark is continuing to be attacked by the world engine at the Indian Ocean, in Metropolis, Perry looks around in the wreckage for his colleagues]
Perry White: Jenny. Jenny! Jenny! Jenny, where are you?
[he sees a hand sticking out of the rubble of a building]
Jenny: I’m here! I’m here! I’m here!
Perry White: Jenny! Hold on, hold on.
[Perry goes over to Jenny and takes hold of her hand]
Jenny: I’m stuck. I can’t get free, I’m stuck!
Perry White: Okay. We’ll get you out there, alright? You just sit tight.
[Perry turns to look behind him]
Jenny: No, no! Don’t leave me! Please don’t leave me!
Perry White: I’m not gonna leave you.
Jenny: Okay. Okay.
[Perry turns and shouts over to Steve]
Perry White: Lombard, get your ass over here and help me!
Steve Lombard: Dammit.
[Steve picks up a large metal pole and hands it to Perry]
Steve Lombard: Gotta move this. Here. Try this. Push that up, okay?
[as they try to get Jenny free, there’s an explosion near them]
Steve Lombard: It’s getting closer! Come on, push!
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Northcom, this is Guardian, are we clear to make the drop?
General Swanwick: Negative, Guardian.
[as the Zod’s ship continues to destroy Metropolis, we see Clark finally fly inside the world engine and destroy it making Zod’s ship stop it’s terraforming process over Metropolis]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: He did it.
[as they fly closer towards Zod’s ship]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Northcom, this is Guardian, we’re passing through phase line and we’re good to go.
General Swanwick: God speed, Guardian. On the package. You are cleared out.
[turning to Lois]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: We’re lining up for the final run. It’s up to you and Hamilton now.
[Lois tries to activate the old ship with Clark’s command key, but it won’t go in]
Lois Lane: Oh, you’ve gotta be kiddin me!
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Load master, is the package armed and are we ready to drop?
Load Master: Negative, Guardian!
[at the back of the aircraft]
Lois Lane: There’s something wrong, it’s not supposed to do this!
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Well what’s it supposed to do?
Lois Lane: It’s supposed to go in all the way.
Dr. Emil Hamilton: Let me take a look.
[at the pilot’s area of the aircraft]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: Co-pilot’s aircraft.
C-17 Co-pilot: Co-pilot’s aircraft.
[Hardy leaves the pilot seat to go and investigate what’s holding up Lois and Hamilton]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: We are lined up for the drop! What’s the hold up?
Dr. Emil Hamilton: We’ve had a slight set-back.
[at that moment Zod flies in with the scoutship and is behind them]
General Zod: Target that aircraft.
Scoutship Voice Guidance: Target locked.
[as Zod is about to fire, suddenly Clark flies into the scoutship and stops him]
Clark Kent: Zod!
General Zod: If you destroy this ship, you destroy Krypton!
Clark Kent: Krypton had its chance!
[Clark uses his heat vision to bring down the scoutship]
[as the scoutship crashes, Faora-Ul uses a pods to fly in toward C-17 aircraft, inside the aircraft Hamilton manages to figure out why the command key won’t go into the mainframe]
Load Master: Miss Lane! Stop standing over there! Miss Lane!
[Faora-Ul flies into the aircraft and throws out the Load Master, making Lois fall out over the edge of the jet, Faora then goes after Hardy and in the process kills the co-pilot; at the back of the jet, Lois gets herself back inside and Hamilton manages to fully insert the command key into the old ship’s mainframe which activates it; at that moment Hardy turns to Faora]
Colonel Nathan Hardy: A good death is its own reward.
[Hardy flies the jet toward Zod’s ship which causes Lois to fall out of the jet, as the jet hits Zod’s ship this causes the Phantom Zone to open, sending everyone inside Zod’s ship back there]
[Clark sees Lois falling from the jet and quickly flies up to save her, he brings her down safely into ruins of Metropolis, Perry, Jenny and Steve notice them from afar]
Jenny: Are they gone?
Perry White: I think so.
Jenny: He saved us.
[after saving Lois, Clark and Lois kiss]
Lois Lane: You know they say it’s all downhill after the first kiss.
Clark Kent: I…I’m pretty sure that only counts if you’re kissing a human.
[they kiss each other again]
[as Clark and Lois are kissing, they hear a noise in the distance, Clark goes over to check what it is and sees Zod kneeling on the ground]
General Zod: Look at this.
[Zod holds out his hand which has some of the burnt rubble from the ground]
General Zod: We could have built a new Krypton in this squalor, but you chose the humans over us. I exist only to protect Krypton, that is the sole purpose for which I was born. And every action I take, no matter how violent, or how cruel, is for the greater good of my people. And now I have no people. My soul, that is what you have taken from me!
[Zod suddenly attacks Clark and throws him aside]
General Zod: I’m going to make them suffer, Kal, these humans you adopted. I will take them all from you, one by one.
Clark Kent: You are a monster, Zod. And I’m gonna stop you.
[they engage in a battle that causes more destruction to Metropolis, leading them to crash into a building, Zod then starts getting overwhelmed by his senses and loses control of his heat vision which destroys the building they’re in, the both fly out of the building as it comes crumbling down, then they come to a stop and Zod throws a fuel truck with the name ‘Lex Corp’ written on it at Clark, this causes a massive explosion, after which they battle it out again]
General Zod: There’s only one way this ends, Kal! Either you die, or I do!
[they fight again and Zod manages to knock Clark down]
General Zod: I was bred to be a warrior, Kal. Trained my entire life to master my senses. Where did you train? On a farm!
[Zod dispenses with his suit’s armor and rises into the air, Clark flies after him and they battle it out across Metropolis, destroying more buildings, eventually they fall through into a historic building with civilians inside, Clark manages to get hold of Zod with his arm around his neck]
General Zod: If you love these people so much, you can mourn for them!
[Zod uses his heat vision to try and kill a family of four that have been cornered]
Clark Kent: Don’t do this! Stop! Don’t!
General Zod: Never!
[as Zod’s heat vision gets closer to the family, Clark snaps Zod’s neck, killing him, Clark then cries out in regret as Lois comes in to comfort him]
[sometime later, as Swanwick and Farris are driving through a military camp, they suddenly see a drone come crashing down in front of them, Swanwick gets out of the car and sees Clark standing by the burning drone]
General Swanwick: Are you F-ing stupid?!
Clark Kent: That’s one of your surveillance drones.
General Swanwick: That’s a twelve million dollar piece of hardware!
Clark Kent: It was. I know you’re trying to find out where I hang my cape, you won’t.
General Swanwick: Then I’ll ask the obvious question. How do we know you won’t one day act against America’s interests?
Clark Kent: I grew up in Kansas, General. I’m about as American as it gets. Look, I’m here to help, but it has to be on my own terms. And you have to convince Washington of that.
General Swanwick: Even if I were willing to try, what makes you think they’d listen?
Clark Kent: I don’t know, General. Guess I’ll just have to trust you.
[Clark flies off, Swanwick turns and walks over to Farris]
General Swanwick: What are you smiling about, Captain?
Major Carrie Farris: Nothing, sir.
[she hesitates for a moment]
Major Carrie Farris: I just think he’s kind of hot.
General Swanwick: Get in the car, Captain.
Major Carrie Farris: Mm-hmm. Yes, sir.
[they walk back to their car]
[Martha and Clark, now in his civilian clothes, are walking over to Jonathan’s grave]
Martha Kent: He always believed you were meant for greater things. And that when the day came, your shoulders would be able to bare the weight.
Clark Kent: Yeah, I just wish he could have been here to see it finally happen.
Martha Kent: He saw it, Clark, believe me.
[we see flashback scene to when Clark was a kid playing in their back yard with their dog, he’s wearing a cape and running around, Jonathan watches him from the side and sees Clark pretending to be a superhero]
Martha Kent: What are you going to do, when you’re not saving the world? Have you given any thought to that?
Clark Kent: I have, actually.
[Clark smiles and looks at Martha]
Clark Kent: I gotta find a job where I can keep my ear to the ground.
[we see as Clark cycling through Metropolis]
Clark Kent: Where people won’t look twice when I wanna go somewhere dangerous, or start asking questions.
[we see Clark entering a building, he straightens his tie as he walks through the Daily Planet, as he gets into an elevator he takes out his glasses from his jacket pocket]
[at the Daily Planet]
Steve Lombard: Come on Lois, when are you going to throw me a bone?
[Steve walks over to Lois’s desk and holds up two tickets]
Steve Lombard: Courtside seats to the game tonight, what do you say?
Lois Lane: I’d say, you should go back to trolling the intern pool, you’ll probably have more luck.
[to Jenny, as Lois hands her a piece of paper]
Lois Lane: Sorry.
[Steve looks at Jenny]
Steve Lombard: Courtside?
[Jenny laughs and shakes her head]
Jenny: Don’t, don’t.
[last lines; Perry walks over to them with Clark walking behind him]
Perry White: Lombard, Lane, I want you to meet our new stringer. I want you to show him the ropes. This is Clark Kent.
[turning to Clark, who’s wearing his glasses now]
Perry White: Good luck, kid.
[Clark and Lois look at each other, Lois smiles as she recognizes Clark]
Steve Lombard: Hey. Steve.
Clark Kent: Nice to meet you.
Steve Lombard: You too.
[Lois rises from her seat and extends her hand to Clark]
Lois Lane: Hi. Lois Lane. Welcome to the Planet.
[they shake hands]
Clark Kent: Glad to be here, Lois.
[they smile at each other]
