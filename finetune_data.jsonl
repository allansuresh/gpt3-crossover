{"prompt": "Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.\nFury:", "completion": " NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase."}
{"prompt": "It just turned itself on?\nFury:", "completion": " What are the energy levels"}
{"prompt": "Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.\nFury:", "completion": " How long to get everyone out?"}
{"prompt": "Campus should be clear in the next half hour.\nFury:", "completion": " Do better."}
{"prompt": "Sir, evacuation may be futile.\nFury:", "completion": " We should tell them to go back to sleep?"}
{"prompt": "If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.\nFury:", "completion": " I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out."}
{"prompt": "Sir, is that really a priority right now?\nFury:", "completion": " Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every peice of Phase 2 on a truck and gone."}
{"prompt": "Yes sir. With me.\nFury:", "completion": " Talk to me doctor."}
{"prompt": "Director.\nFury:", "completion": " Is there anything we know for certain?"}
{"prompt": "The Tesseract is misbehaving.\nFury:", "completion": " Is that supposed to be funny?"}
{"prompt": "No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving.\nFury:", "completion": " How soon until you pull the plug?"}
{"prompt": "She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...\nFury:", "completion": " We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space."}
{"prompt": "We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.\nFury:", "completion": " That can be harmful. Where's Barton?"}
{"prompt": "The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual\nFury:", "completion": " Agent Barton, report."}
{"prompt": "Agent Barton, report.\nFury:", "completion": " I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things."}
{"prompt": "Well, I see better from a distance.\nFury:", "completion": " Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?"}
{"prompt": "Doctor, it's spiking again.\nHawkeye:", "completion": " No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end."}
{"prompt": "No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contancts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.\nFury:", "completion": " At this end?"}
{"prompt": "At this end?\nHawkeye:", "completion": " Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.\nFury:", "completion": " Sir please put down the spear."}
{"prompt": "Sir please put down the spear.\nLoki:", "completion": " You have heart."}
{"prompt": "You have heart.\nLoki:", "completion": " Please don't. I still need that."}
{"prompt": "Please don't. I still need that.\nFury:", "completion": " This doesn't have to get any messier."}
{"prompt": "This doesn't have to get any messier.\nLoki:", "completion": " Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose."}
{"prompt": "Loki? Brother of Thor?\nFury:", "completion": " We have no quarrel with your people."}
{"prompt": "We have no quarrel with your people.\nLoki:", "completion": " An ant had no quarrel with a boot."}
{"prompt": "An ant had no quarrel with a boot.\nFury:", "completion": " You planning to step on us?"}
{"prompt": "You planning to step on us?\nLoki:", "completion": " I come with glad tidings, of a world made free."}
{"prompt": "I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.\nFury:", "completion": " Free from what?"}
{"prompt": "Free from what?\nLoki:", "completion": " Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart..."}
{"prompt": "Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...\nLoki:", "completion": " You will know peace."}
{"prompt": "You will know peace.\nFury:", "completion": " Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.\nHawkeye:", "completion": " Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us."}
{"prompt": "Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us.\nFury:", "completion": " Like the Pharaohs of Odin."}
{"prompt": "He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.\nLoki:", "completion": " Well then."}
{"prompt": "Well then.\nHawkeye:", "completion": " Need these vehicles."}
{"prompt": "Who's that?\nHawkeye:", "completion": " He didn't tell me."}
{"prompt": "He didn't tell me.\nFury:", "completion": " Hill, do you copy?"}
{"prompt": "Hill, do you copy?\nFury:", "completion": " Barton is..."}
{"prompt": "Barton is...\nFury:", "completion": " He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!"}
{"prompt": "Director? Director Fury, do you copy?\nFury:", "completion": " The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?"}
{"prompt": "A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors.\nFury:", "completion": " Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase."}
{"prompt": "Roger that.\nFury:", "completion": " Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war."}
{"prompt": "This is not how I wanted the evening to go.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better."}
{"prompt": "I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business."}
{"prompt": "Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You really think I'm pretty?"}
{"prompt": "We need you to come in.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Are you kidding? I'm working!"}
{"prompt": "This takes precedence.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything."}
{"prompt": "I don't give everything.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Look, you can't pull me out of this right now."}
{"prompt": "Natasha. Barton's been compromised.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Let me put you on hold."}
{"prompt": "Let me put you on hold.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Where's Barton now?"}
{"prompt": "We don't know.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " But he's alive."}
{"prompt": "We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me."}
{"prompt": "No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Bozhe moi."}
{"prompt": "Should have gotten paid up front, Banner.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle."}
{"prompt": "Avoiding stress isn't the secret.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Then, what is it? Yoga?"}
{"prompt": "Then, what is it? Yoga?\nBruce Banner:", "completion": " You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?"}
{"prompt": "You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Just you and me."}
{"prompt": "And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I did."}
{"prompt": "Who are you?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Natasha Romanoff."}
{"prompt": "Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD."}
{"prompt": "SHIELD. How did they find me?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent."}
{"prompt": "Why?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in."}
{"prompt": "What if I said no?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I'll persuade you."}
{"prompt": "And what if the... other guy says no?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak."}
{"prompt": "I don't always get what I want.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe."}
{"prompt": "Well, those I actively try to avoid.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet."}
{"prompt": "What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be."}
{"prompt": "So Fury isn't after the monster?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Not that he's told me."}
{"prompt": "And he tells you everything?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Talk to Fury, he needs you on this."}
{"prompt": "He needs me in a cage?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " No one's gonna put you in a..."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Stand down. We're good here."}
{"prompt": "This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control.\nFury:", "completion": " You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?"}
{"prompt": "You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?\nFury:", "completion": " Not Asgard, Loki."}
{"prompt": "He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.\nFury:", "completion": " Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us."}
{"prompt": "Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly...\nFury:", "completion": " PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team."}
{"prompt": "The Avengers Initiative was shut down.\nFury:", "completion": " This isn't about The Avengers."}
{"prompt": "We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.\nFury:", "completion": " I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need."}
{"prompt": "War isn't won by sentiment, Director.\nFury:", "completion": " No, it's won by soldiers."}
{"prompt": "No, it's won by soldiers.\nSteve:", "completion": " There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!"}
{"prompt": "This guy is still alive!\nFury:", "completion": " Trouble sleeping?"}
{"prompt": "Trouble sleeping?\nSteve:", "completion": " I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill."}
{"prompt": "I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.\nFury:", "completion": " Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world."}
{"prompt": "Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.\nSteve:", "completion": " I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost."}
{"prompt": "I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.\nFury:", "completion": " We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently."}
{"prompt": "We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.\nSteve:", "completion": " You here with a mission, sir?"}
{"prompt": "You here with a mission, sir?\nFury:", "completion": " I am."}
{"prompt": "I am.\nSteve:", "completion": " Trying to get me back in the world?"}
{"prompt": "Trying to get me back in the world?\nFury:", "completion": " Trying to save it."}
{"prompt": "Trying to save it.\nSteve:", "completion": " Hydra's secret weapon."}
{"prompt": "Hydra's secret weapon.\nFury:", "completion": " Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs."}
{"prompt": "Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.\nSteve:", "completion": " Who took it from you?"}
{"prompt": "Who took it from you?\nFury:", "completion": " He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know."}
{"prompt": "He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.\nSteve:", "completion": " At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me."}
{"prompt": "At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.\nFury:", "completion": " Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment."}
{"prompt": "Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.\nFury:", "completion": " Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?"}
{"prompt": "Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?\nSteve:", "completion": " You should have left it in the ocean."}
{"prompt": "You should have left it in the ocean.\nTony:", "completion": " You're good on this end. The rest is up to you."}
{"prompt": "You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?\nTony:", "completion": " Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy."}
{"prompt": "Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?\nTony:", "completion": " I assume. Light her up."}
{"prompt": "How does it look?\nTony:", "completion": " Like Christmas, but with more... me."}
{"prompt": "PEPPER Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment."}
{"prompt": "Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm not in. I'm actually out."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.\nTony:", "completion": " Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date."}
{"prompt": "Levels are holding steady... I think.\nTony:", "completion": " Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?"}
{"prompt": "Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?\nTony:", "completion": " What do you mean? All this came from you."}
{"prompt": "No. All this came from that.\nTony:", "completion": " Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit."}
{"prompt": "Twelve percent?\nTony:", "completion": " An argument can be made for fifteen."}
{"prompt": "Twelve percent? For my baby?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you."}
{"prompt": "Oooooh.\nTony:", "completion": " My private elevator..."}
{"prompt": "You mean our elevator?\nTony:", "completion": " Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?"}
{"prompt": "Not gonna be that subtle.\nTony:", "completion": " I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower."}
{"prompt": "On the lease.\nTony:", "completion": " Call your mom, can you bunk over?"}
{"prompt": "Stark, we need to talk.\nTony:", "completion": " You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message."}
{"prompt": "This is urgent.\nTony:", "completion": " Then leave it urgently. Security breach. That's on you."}
{"prompt": "Phil! Come in.\nTony:", "completion": " Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent."}
{"prompt": "I can't stay\nTony:", "completion": " Which is why he can't stay."}
{"prompt": "We need you to look this over. Soon as possible.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't like being handed things."}
{"prompt": "That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade. Thank you.\nTony:", "completion": " Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday."}
{"prompt": "Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.\nTony:", "completion": " The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify."}
{"prompt": "I didn't know that either.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others."}
{"prompt": "This isn't about personality profiles anymore.\nTony:", "completion": " Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?"}
{"prompt": "Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?\nTony:", "completion": " You know, I thought we were having a moment."}
{"prompt": "I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.\nTony:", "completion": " How did you notice? Why is he Phil?"}
{"prompt": "What is all of this?\nTony:", "completion": " This is, uh... This."}
{"prompt": "I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.\nTony:", "completion": " Tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, what if I didn't?"}
{"prompt": "If you didn't?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "You mean if you finished? Well, um...then.\nTony:", "completion": " Square deal. It's the last date."}
{"prompt": "We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.\nSteve:", "completion": " So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?"}
{"prompt": "A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.\nSteve:", "completion": " Didn't really go his way, did it?"}
{"prompt": "Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking. He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board.\nSteve:", "completion": " Well, I hope I'm the man for the job."}
{"prompt": "Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.\nSteve:", "completion": " The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?"}
{"prompt": "The Chitauri grow restless\nLoki:", "completion": " Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle."}
{"prompt": "Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?\nLoki:", "completion": " Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim."}
{"prompt": "You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?\nLoki:", "completion": " I was a king! The rightful kind of Asgard! Betrayed!"}
{"prompt": "Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.\nLoki:", "completion": " You don't have the Tesseract yet. I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words."}
{"prompt": "Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.\nSteve:", "completion": " Ma'am?"}
{"prompt": "Ma'am?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Hi. They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace."}
{"prompt": "See you there.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?"}
{"prompt": "It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?\nSteve:", "completion": " Trading cards?"}
{"prompt": "Trading cards?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " They're vintage, he's very proud."}
{"prompt": "They're vintage, he's very proud.\nSteve:", "completion": " Dr. Banner."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.\nSteve:", "completion": " Word is you can find the cube."}
{"prompt": "Is that the only word on me?\nSteve:", "completion": " Only word I care about."}
{"prompt": "It must be strange for you, all of this.\nSteve:", "completion": " Well, this is actually kind of familiar."}
{"prompt": "Well, this is actually kind of familiar.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath."}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.\nSteve:", "completion": " Is this a submarine?"}
{"prompt": "We're at lock, sir.\nFury:", "completion": " Good. Let's vanish."}
{"prompt": "Good. Let's vanish.\nFury:", "completion": " Gentlemen. Doctor, thank you for coming."}
{"prompt": "Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?\nFury:", "completion": " Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear."}
{"prompt": "We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " That's still not gonna find them in time."}
{"prompt": "You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?\nFury:", "completion": " How many are there?"}
{"prompt": "Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?\nFury:", "completion": " Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please."}
{"prompt": "Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys."}
{"prompt": "Put it over there! Where did you find all these people?\nHawkeye:", "completion": " SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. . Is this the stuff you need?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.\nHawkeye:", "completion": " Especially if SHIELD knows you need it."}
{"prompt": "Well, I didn't know! Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.\nLoki:", "completion": " I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?"}
{"prompt": "I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?\nHawkeye:", "completion": " My next target."}
{"prompt": "My next target.\nLoki:", "completion": " Tell me what you need."}
{"prompt": "Tell me what you need.\nHawkeye:", "completion": " I'll need a distraction. And an eyeball."}
{"prompt": "I mean, if it's not too much trouble.\nSteve:", "completion": " No, no. It's fine."}
{"prompt": "Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding.\nFury:", "completion": " Captain, you're up."}
{"prompt": "Captain, you're up.\nLoki:", "completion": " Kneel before me. I said KNEEL! Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel."}
{"prompt": "Not to men like you.\nLoki:", "completion": " There are no men like me."}
{"prompt": "There are always men like you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example."}
{"prompt": "Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.\nSteve:", "completion": " You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing."}
{"prompt": "You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.\nLoki:", "completion": " The soldier. A man out of time."}
{"prompt": "The soldier. A man out of time.\nSteve:", "completion": " I'm not the one who's out of time."}
{"prompt": "I'm not the one who's out of time.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Loki, drop the weapon and stand down."}
{"prompt": "Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.\nLoki:", "completion": " Kneel."}
{"prompt": "Kneel.\nSteve:", "completion": " Not today!"}
{"prompt": "Not today!\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " This guy's all over the place."}
{"prompt": "This guy's all over the place.\nTony:", "completion": " Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Make your move, Reindeer Games."}
{"prompt": "Agent Romanoff, did you miss me? Make your move, Reindeer Games.\nTony:", "completion": " Good move."}
{"prompt": "Good move.\nSteve:", "completion": " Mr. Stark."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Captain."}
{"prompt": "Said anything?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Not a word."}
{"prompt": "Just get him here. We're low on time.\nSteve:", "completion": " I don't like it."}
{"prompt": "I don't like it.\nTony:", "completion": " What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?"}
{"prompt": "What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?\nSteve:", "completion": " I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop."}
{"prompt": "I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.\nTony:", "completion": " Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?"}
{"prompt": "Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?\nSteve:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle."}
{"prompt": "It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.\nSteve:", "completion": " Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in."}
{"prompt": "Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Where's this coming from?"}
{"prompt": "Where's this coming from?\nSteve:", "completion": " What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?"}
{"prompt": "What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?\nLoki:", "completion": " I'm not overly fond of what follows."}
{"prompt": "I'm not overly fond of what follows.\nTony:", "completion": " Now there's that guy."}
{"prompt": "Now there's that guy.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Another Asgardian?"}
{"prompt": "Another Asgardian?\nSteve:", "completion": " Think the guy's a friendly?"}
{"prompt": "Think the guy's a friendly?\nTony:", "completion": " Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.\nSteve:", "completion": " Stark, we need a plan of attack!"}
{"prompt": "Stark, we need a plan of attack!\nTony:", "completion": " I have a plan. Attack."}
{"prompt": "I have a plan. Attack.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I'd sit this one out, Cap."}
{"prompt": "I'd sit this one out, Cap.\nSteve:", "completion": " I don't see how I can."}
{"prompt": "I don't see how I can.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " These guys come from legends, they're basically gods."}

{"prompt": "I think it's possible to bring her back.\nScott:", "completion": " Okay. We're in. Aw, this place is a maze. Where's that map? We're definitely close. Are you ready?"}
{"prompt": "I'm ready, Daddy.\nScott:", "completion": " Are you sure? Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we're done."}
{"prompt": "I eat fear for breakfast.\nScott:", "completion": " Wow. That is super cool. Come on."}
{"prompt": "Wow. That is super cool. Come on.\nScott:", "completion": " Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? Anton, which way do we go?!"}
{"prompt": "Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? Anton, which way do we go?!\nScott:", "completion": " Thanks Anton!"}
{"prompt": "Thanks Anton!\nScott:", "completion": " Look! The ants have burrowed into the tech facility."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no! Lasers!\nScott:", "completion": " Oh! I think I got lased!"}
{"prompt": "Oh! I think I got lased!\nScott:", "completion": " The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens."}
{"prompt": "Yup!\nScott:", "completion": " Perfect! Right there."}
{"prompt": "There! It's the microtreasure!\nScott:", "completion": " My trophy?"}
{"prompt": "It looks like treasure.\nScott:", "completion": " Oh, it is to me."}
{"prompt": "I wanna take it to show and tell.\nScott:", "completion": " Oh, you can't do that. Can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I'm so touched you think I'm the 'World's Greatest Grandma.'\""}
{"prompt": "It was the only one they had.\nScott:", "completion": " Makes me wanna knit you a sweater."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings, and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?\nScott:", "completion": " No, no, not at all."}
{"prompt": "You sure? 'Cause it's a lot of security cameras.\nScott:", "completion": " I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business?"}
{"prompt": "You are, but I'm running the company, and if we oversell it, he's gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird.\nScott:", "completion": " He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is \"'land this fish.\""}
{"prompt": "No. It's \"land the bird.\" Just like you land a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business.\nScott:", "completion": " I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do."}
{"prompt": "How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on a shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?\nScott:", "completion": " You really turned me around on this thing. It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me, I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter."}
{"prompt": "Let's bounce before the po-po come back.\nScott:", "completion": " The po-po? How do you even know that? Let's fly Antionette. Let's fly!"}
{"prompt": "The po-po? How do you even know that? Let's fly Antionette. Let's fly!\nScott:", "completion": " Crash landing!"}
{"prompt": "I wish we could shrink for real.\nScott:", "completion": " Oh, that is pretty cool!"}
{"prompt": "Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I'm way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff, and my hands are shaking, but I think that's unrelated, you know?\nScott:", "completion": " It's gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about."}
{"prompt": "Daddy!\nScott:", "completion": " Come on, Woo! I got three days left. Why would I try to escape?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern. Soup to nuts.\nScott:", "completion": " Thank you. It was an accident. My foot went through the fence."}
{"prompt": "Our flying ant crashed.\nScott:", "completion": " Hey, you try entertaining a ten-year-old when you can't leave the house. You know the lengths that I've gone to? Close up magic. I learned that."}
{"prompt": "Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three years of probation. and avoid any unauthorized activities, technology, or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, in violation of said Accords, or any related statutes. Okay sweetie?\nScott:", "completion": " Wow, you're really great with kids."}
{"prompt": "Thanks, I'm also a youth pastor. Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ask-A-Lot, but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne, have you?\nScott:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And I don't need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum.\nScott:", "completion": " I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever."}
{"prompt": "They hate his guts.\nScott:", "completion": " Thanks, peanut."}
{"prompt": "How'd you do it, Scott?\nScott:", "completion": " Do what?"}
{"prompt": "The card trick.\nScott:", "completion": " Seriously?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, get on the inside of this. Three days! Seriously? I'm proud of you, buddy.\nScott:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "I had a fun weekend, Daddy.\nScott:", "completion": " Me too, Peanut. Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta here, we're gonna go paint this town red. We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking."}
{"prompt": "Bye, Daddy!\nScott:", "completion": " Three days... Easy-peasy."}
{"prompt": "Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there. Now that is misdirection.\nScott:", "completion": " Easy-peasy..."}
{"prompt": "Easy-peasy...\nScott:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "You always find me, Mommy.\nScott:", "completion": " What the hell?"}
{"prompt": "What the hell?\nScott:", "completion": " Hey, Hank.It's been a while.Umm... I don't even know if this is your number anymore... and, I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But... I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... very real.I was back in the Quantum Realm, and... I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife.I mean, not in a weird way...You know... hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, it's not an emergency. I'm sorry to bother you.I'm sorry for a lot of things.\""}
{"prompt": "Do you think it's a dream, or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there?\nScott:", "completion": " I'm not sure... I can't be here! I can't be,I'm under house arrest."}
{"prompt": "They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.\nScott:", "completion": " You have to take me home. They can show up any second."}
{"prompt": "He's programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed, five hours in front of the TV, two hours in the bathroom - whatever that's about.\nScott:", "completion": " That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?"}
{"prompt": "We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we've had is you.\nScott:", "completion": " I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, that Cap needed help-"}
{"prompt": "Cap?\nScott:", "completion": " ...tain America. Captain... Cap. It's what we call him.  If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend, a little. I know him. He's nice. Whatever... I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught."}
{"prompt": "You didn't think about a lot of things.\nScott:", "completion": " How's Hank?"}
{"prompt": "We're still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is?\nScott:", "completion": " I'm sorry. I know you're mad."}
{"prompt": "I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head.\nScott:", "completion": " Is this where you're living? If you need help, money or something, maybe I can..."}
{"prompt": "We're fine.\nScott:", "completion": " Hey, Hank. Look... I just want to-"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home, we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down there, we just don't know where.\nScott:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "If we can pinpoint my Mom's location, then the pod can take me down to get her.\nScott:", "completion": " You built all this and you don't even know if she's alive?"}
{"prompt": "It's called a hypothesis. Last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the Quantum Realm was opened.\nScott:", "completion": " And?"}
{"prompt": "And five minutes later, you called. Talking about Mom. We think when you went down there, you may have entangled with her.\nScott:", "completion": " Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much."}
{"prompt": "We think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it.\nScott:", "completion": " Your Mom put a message in my head? Come on. That's insane."}
{"prompt": "No, Scott. Insane... is going to Germany without telling us and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it.\nScott:", "completion": " I did. I destroyed it. I swear."}
{"prompt": "I can't believe you destroyed my suit. That was my life's work.\nScott:", "completion": " What was I supposed to do?"}
{"prompt": "You were supposed to not take my suit!\nScott:", "completion": " I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry I took the suit. I'm sorry that I called last night. I don't remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl."}
{"prompt": "What?\nScott:", "completion": " I had a dream. She was playing hide and seek with a little... girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn't mean anything."}
{"prompt": "But, was it Cassie in the dream?\nScott:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "The little girl, where was she hiding. Was it in a wardrobe?\nScott:", "completion": " No, it's in a tall dresser."}
{"prompt": "You mean a wardrobe.\nScott:", "completion": " Is that what that's called?"}
{"prompt": "What color was it?\nScott:", "completion": " Red."}
{"prompt": "Were there horses on it?\nScott:", "completion": " Oh, boy."}
{"prompt": "It's where I hid every time we played.\nScott:", "completion": " Doesn't sound like you really got the gist of the game."}
{"prompt": "We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I brought your clothes. You might wanna change.\nScott:", "completion": " Look. I'd really like to help you out. But if I'm not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever."}
{"prompt": "You owe us.\nScott:", "completion": " All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I'm not supposed to be out here."}
{"prompt": "I'll be right back.\nScott:", "completion": " Can I have one of those?"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm good. Thank you.\nScott:", "completion": " Who is this guy?"}
{"prompt": "Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.\nScott:", "completion": " Can I just have one?"}
{"prompt": "You know, I have a special friend, down at the FBI. And I say special, because... Well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know. For example... Your name isn't Susan. It's Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.\nScott:", "completion": " That's not good, Hank."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nScott:", "completion": " So now what?"}
{"prompt": "She said her and daddy had something pressing.I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not working with us, they're working with somebody.So find out. Name...\nScott:", "completion": " Hold on.You gave her wings?"}
{"prompt": "Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier! Stop firing! Stop! Alright, take this. Go. Go, go, go, go!\nScott:", "completion": " Wings and blasters. I take it you didn't have that tech available for me?"}
{"prompt": "\nScott:", "completion": " I gotta do something."}
{"prompt": "Wait! It's still a work in progress.\nScott:", "completion": " You taught me that kick. Remember?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, great form.\nScott:", "completion": " Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?"}
{"prompt": "I don't know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is.\nScott:", "completion": " So where to now? How about my house?"}
{"prompt": "Mmm?\nScott:", "completion": " I'm supposed to be there anyway. Woo could walk in any second."}
{"prompt": "Exactly why we're not going to your house.\nScott:", "completion": " What about your house?  Sorry. There is one place I can think of."}
{"prompt": "You know what, you can get creative with it. Put a little brown sugar on it. Sprinkle some cinnamon...\nScott:", "completion": " Guys, guys, guys, guys! Come on, man! We got bigger fish to fry. Is that my desk?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nScott:", "completion": " What? Why do I have such a small desk?"}
{"prompt": "- You snooze, you lose.\nScott:", "completion": " I was under house arrest."}
{"prompt": "Luis Yeah!\nScott:", "completion": " You know what, this isn't even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage. I got it out of rummage sale. - So, you saved money on my desk? - Guys. Hope, please! We need to focus. All right? We gotta find that lab already. Geez. Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. Like this crazy, creepy cat who like, walks through walls and stuff. Like a... Like a Ghost! Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga. A witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga? Whoever stole it... We need to find it. Well, you don't find someone like that. - They find you. - Like Baba Yaga. Dr. Pym, you're like the smartest genius I know. Did you put some kind of lojack on your lab? Because if you didn't, we have a variety of affordable options. Of course, I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing. - They also looked like they were phasing. - Phasing? Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter. Oh, yeah. That's what I was thinking. The lab emits radiation. Could we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes. But all of my equipment is in the lab. Well, where else can we find that equipment? Well, there is one person. - Bill Foster. - Great! Who's Bill Foster? He's an old colleague of my Dad's. From SHIELD. - They had a falling out years ago. - You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It's probably just a waste of time. Hey, I'm risking everything by being here. Don't you think we should check? We need to find out who took the lab. Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this. Relax. No one's gonna recognize us. What, because of hats and sunglasses? It's not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves in a baseball game. In an isolated system... Particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. Each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words... The object in question would be both in and out of phase with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality... I am noticing an unusally high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why don't we call it a few minutes early. That will be enough for today, thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go. It's incredible. Your link to Janet. It's Quantum entanglement, between the quantum states composed of her molecules and your brains. Yeah. It's what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word 'quantum' in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't have the equipment you're describing. I told you this was a waste of time. Come on. Let's go. Don't condescend, Hank. You're the one who's on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego. That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really? Going that big must've been exhausting. I slept for three days straight. You have no idea. Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hank's partner in a project called Goliath. Excuse me, you were my partner? The only thing more tiring than going that big, is putting up with Hank's bullshit. How big did you get? My record? Twenty-one feet."}
{"prompt": "Daddy!\nScott:", "completion": " Hold on. Move! Get outta here!"}
{"prompt": "No. Don't. Don't!\nScott:", "completion": " Ah!"}
{"prompt": "Ow.\nScott:", "completion": " Ow,gross! Ugh,I hate that moth dust.Go. Shoo! Shoo!"}
{"prompt": "Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel. This is... smaller.\nScott:", "completion": " Oh. Sorry. My bad."}
{"prompt": "Ah, I think it has flair.\nScott:", "completion": " Alright. Control's online."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?\nAquaman:", "completion": " Something that worked for Pinnochio."}
{"prompt": "Who?\nAquaman:", "completion": " Never mind. Get in. Get in. Come on!"}
{"prompt": "You understand me.\nAquaman:", "completion": " I do."}
{"prompt": "Finish it.\nAquaman:", "completion": " Yield the throne."}
{"prompt": "Hail to the king!\nAquaman:", "completion": " So what do I do now?"}
{"prompt": "Be their king.\nAquaman:", "completion": " This is going to be fun."}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nAquaman:", "completion": " My father was a lighthouse keeper. My mother was a queen. They were never meant to meet, but their love saved the world. They made me what I am. A son of the land, a king of the seas. I am the protector of the deep. I am Aquaman."}
{"prompt": "Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.\nTony:", "completion": " Shit!"}
{"prompt": "Shit!\nSteve:", "completion": " Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?"}
{"prompt": "The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken.\nThor:", "completion": " Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.\nTony:", "completion": " Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said \"language?\""}
{"prompt": "Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said \"language?\"\nSteve:", "completion": " I know. It just slipped out."}
{"prompt": "Sir, the city is taking fire.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion."}
{"prompt": "You didn't see that coming?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Clint!"}
{"prompt": "Clint!\nSteve:", "completion": " We have an enhanced in the field."}
{"prompt": "We have an enhanced in the field.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Clint's hit! Somebody want to deal with that bunker? Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Clint's hit! Somebody want to deal with that bunker? Thank you.\nSteve:", "completion": " Stark, we really need to get inside."}
{"prompt": "Stark, we really need to get inside.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?"}
{"prompt": "There's a particle wave below the north tower.\nTony:", "completion": " Great, I wanna poke it with something. Drawbridge is down, people."}
{"prompt": "Great, I wanna poke it with something. Drawbridge is down, people.\nThor:", "completion": " The enhanced?"}
{"prompt": "The enhanced?\nSteve:", "completion": " He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't."}
{"prompt": "He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac."}
{"prompt": "Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.\nThor:", "completion": " I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter."}
{"prompt": "I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.\nSteve:", "completion": " Copy that."}
{"prompt": "Copy that.\nThor:", "completion": " It looks like they're lining up."}
{"prompt": "It looks like they're lining up.\nSteve:", "completion": " Well, they're excited."}
{"prompt": "Well, they're excited.\nThor:", "completion": " Find the scepter."}
{"prompt": "Find the scepter.\nTony:", "completion": " And for gosh sake, watch your language!"}
{"prompt": "And for gosh sake, watch your language!\nSteve:", "completion": " That's not going away anytime soon."}
{"prompt": "That's not going away anytime soon.\nTony:", "completion": " Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through. It was a good talk."}
{"prompt": "No it wasn't.\nTony:", "completion": " Sentry mode. Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ."}
{"prompt": "Sentry mode. Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " We're locked down out here."}
{"prompt": "We're locked down out here.\nSteve:", "completion": " Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby."}
{"prompt": "Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby.\nTony:", "completion": " I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick."}
{"prompt": "The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement... and an air current.\nTony:", "completion": " Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door... Yay!"}

{"prompt": "Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.\nSteve:", "completion": " Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug."}
{"prompt": "Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.\nSteve:", "completion": " Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?"}
{"prompt": "Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.\nSteve:", "completion": " I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation. How many are there? Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage."}
{"prompt": "You'll have to be faster than--\nSteve:", "completion": " Guys, I got Strucker."}

{"prompt": "No, but this... this brings it to a close.\nSteve:", "completion": " As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?"}

Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?\nTony:", "completion": " Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you? I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?"}
{"prompt": "Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you? I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels."}
{"prompt": "Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?\nSteve:", "completion": " Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels."}
{"prompt": "Lab's all set up, boss.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler."}

{"prompt": "NATO's got him.\nSteve:", "completion": " The two enhanced?"}
{"prompt": "Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.\nSteve:", "completion": " Their abilities?"}
{"prompt": "He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation. He's fast and she's weird.\nSteve:", "completion": " Well, they're going to show up again."}
{"prompt": "Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.\nSteve:", "completion": " Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?"}
{"prompt": "We're not at war, Captain.\nSteve:", "completion": " They are."}
{"prompt": "How's he doing?\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton."}
{"prompt": "That's terrible.\nTony:", "completion": " He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis."}
{"prompt": "The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.\nTony:", "completion": " So there's elements you can."}
{"prompt": "The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.\nTony:", "completion": " Like a reactor?"}
{"prompt": "Like a computer. I believe I'm deciphering code.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together."}
{"prompt": "If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.\nTony:", "completion": " Here's your beverage."}
{"prompt": "That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday."}
{"prompt": "What's the rumpus?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize,"}
{"prompt": "Doctor.\nTony:", "completion": " Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."}
{"prompt": "Oh?\nTony:", "completion": " Top of the line."}
{"prompt": "I suspect not for long.\nTony:", "completion": " Meet the competition."}
{"prompt": "It's beautiful.\nTony:", "completion": " If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?"}
{"prompt": "Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a... it's not a human mind, it...\nTony:", "completion": " Um-um."}
{"prompt": "I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.\nTony:", "completion": " Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door."}
{"prompt": "Artificial intelligence.\nTony:", "completion": " This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron."}
{"prompt": "I thought Ultron was a fantasy.\nTony:", "completion": " Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol."}
{"prompt": "That's a mad-sized if.\nTony:", "completion": " Our job is \"if.\" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA."}
{"prompt": "Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.\nTony:", "completion": " As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?"}
{"prompt": "The only people threatening the planet would be people?\nTony:", "completion": " I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days."}
{"prompt": "So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.\nTony:", "completion": " Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the \"man was not meant to meddle\" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world."}
{"prompt": "Sounds like a cold world, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that. What did we miss?"}
{"prompt": "I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.\nTony:", "completion": " Thanks, buddy."}
{"prompt": "Enjoy yourself, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " I always do."}
{"prompt": "I don't get it. The mission. G-give me a second.\nTony:", "completion": " Peace in our time."}
{"prompt": "Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, \"Boom! You looking for this?\" \"Boom! Are you looking...\" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.\nThor:", "completion": " That's the whole story?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's a War Machine story.\nThor:", "completion": " Well, it's very good then. It's impressive."}
{"prompt": "Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?\nTony:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, Miss Potts has a company to run."}
{"prompt": "Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer."}
{"prompt": "Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.\nTony:", "completion": " And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting."}
{"prompt": "And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.\nThor:", "completion": " There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize."}
{"prompt": "Let's go.\nThor:", "completion": " But Jane's better."}
{"prompt": "Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.\nSteve:", "completion": " If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.\nSteve:", "completion": " Be it ever so humble."}
{"prompt": "You find a place in Brooklyn yet?\nSteve:", "completion": " I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn."}
{"prompt": "I gotta have some of that!\nThor:", "completion": " Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men."}
{"prompt": "Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.\nThor:", "completion": " Alright."}
{"prompt": "How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Fella done me wrong."}
{"prompt": "You got a lousy taste in men, kid.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win."}
{"prompt": "Sounds amazing.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " He's also a huge dork. Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?"}
{"prompt": "Run with it, right? Or, did he... Was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Not a damn thing. But never say never."}
{"prompt": "Not a damn thing. But never say never.\nSteve:", "completion": " It's nice."}
{"prompt": "What, what, what is?\nSteve:", "completion": " You and Romanoff."}
{"prompt": "No, we haven't. That wasn't...\nSteve:", "completion": " It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed."}
{"prompt": "No, Natasha, she... she likes to flirt.\nSteve:", "completion": " I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on \"waiting too long;\" don't. You both deserve a win."}
{"prompt": "But, it's a trick!\nThor:", "completion": " Oh, no. It's much more than that."}
{"prompt": "Uh, \"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!\" Whatever man! It's a trick.\nThor:", "completion": " Well please, be my guest."}
{"prompt": "Well please, be my guest.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on."}
{"prompt": "Really?\nThor:", "completion": " Yeah!"}
{"prompt": "Oh this is gonna be beautiful.\nTony:", "completion": " Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up."}
{"prompt": "You know I've seen this before, right? I still don't know how you do it.\nTony:", "completion": " Smell the silent judgment?"}
{"prompt": "Please, Stark, by all means.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Oh, here we go."}
{"prompt": "Um-hmm.\nTony:", "completion": " Never one to shrink from an honest challenge."}
{"prompt": "Get after it.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Here we go."}
{"prompt": "Here we go.\nTony:", "completion": " It's physics."}
{"prompt": "Physics!\nTony:", "completion": " Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?"}
{"prompt": "Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, of course."}
{"prompt": "Yes, of course.\nTony:", "completion": " I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. I'll be right back."}
{"prompt": "Are you even pulling?\nTony:", "completion": " Are you on my team?"}
{"prompt": "Just represent! Pull!\nTony:", "completion": " Alright, let's go!"}
{"prompt": "Huh?\nTony:", "completion": " Let's go, Steve, no pressure."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Cap.\nThor:", "completion": " Nothing."}
{"prompt": "Nothing.\nTony:", "completion": " And?"}
{"prompt": "Widow?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered."}
{"prompt": "Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.\nTony:", "completion": " All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged."}
{"prompt": "Steve, he said a bad language word.\nSteve:", "completion": " Did you tell everyone about that?"}
{"prompt": "Did you tell everyone about that?\nTony:", "completion": " The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. \"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints\" is, I think, the literal translation?"}
{"prompt": "The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. \"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints\" is, I think, the literal translation?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. You're all not worthy."}
{"prompt": "Worthy... No, how could you be worthy? You're all killers.\nSteve:", "completion": " Stark."}
{"prompt": "Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " JARVIS."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a-dream?\nTony:", "completion": " Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit."}
{"prompt": "There was a terrible noise... and I was tangled in... in... strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.\nSteve:", "completion": " You killed someone?"}
{"prompt": "Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.\nThor:", "completion": " Who sent you?"}
{"prompt": "In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this... chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " What mission?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry!\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Don't turn green!"}
{"prompt": "I won't!\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Come!"}
{"prompt": "Come!\nSteve:", "completion": " Stark!"}
{"prompt": "We are here to help.\nTony:", "completion": " One sec, one sec I got this!"}
{"prompt": "Hmm.\nSteve:", "completion": " Thor!"}
{"prompt": "It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on! That's the one!"}
{"prompt": "All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.\nSteve:", "completion": " Ultron."}
{"prompt": "Ultron.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other."}
{"prompt": "Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Nukes? He said he wanted us dead."}
{"prompt": "Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.\nSteve:", "completion": " He didn't say dead. He said extinct."}
{"prompt": "But there wasn't anyone else in the building.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes there was."}
{"prompt": "This is insane.\nSteve:", "completion": " JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense."}
{"prompt": "Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on. Use your words, buddy."}
{"prompt": "Come on. Use your words, buddy.\nThor:", "completion": " I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark."}
{"prompt": "I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.\nSteve:", "completion": " Thor! The Legionnaire."}
{"prompt": "Thor! The Legionnaire.\nThor:", "completion": " Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again."}
{"prompt": "Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron."}
{"prompt": "I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?\nThor:", "completion": " You think this is funny?"}
{"prompt": "You think this is funny?\nTony:", "completion": " No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible."}
{"prompt": "No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible.\nThor:", "completion": " This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand."}
{"prompt": "This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.\nTony:", "completion": " No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this."}
{"prompt": "Tony, maybe this might not be the time to--\nTony:", "completion": " Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls."}
{"prompt": "Only when I've created a murder bot.\nTony:", "completion": " We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?"}
{"prompt": "We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?\nSteve:", "completion": " Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD."}
{"prompt": "Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.\nTony:", "completion": " Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?"}
{"prompt": "No, it's never come up.\nTony:", "completion": " Saved New York?"}
{"prompt": "Never heard that.\nTony:", "completion": " Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?"}
{"prompt": "Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?\nSteve:", "completion": " Together."}
{"prompt": "Together.\nTony:", "completion": " We'll lose."}
{"prompt": "We'll lose.\nSteve:", "completion": " Then we'll do that together, too. Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller."}
{"prompt": "Then we'll do that together, too. Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.\nWanda:", "completion": " Talk. And if you are wasting our time..."}
{"prompt": "Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.\nWanda:", "completion": " Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself."}
{"prompt": "Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.\nWanda:", "completion": " I didn't expect... But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct."}
{"prompt": "Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.\nWanda:", "completion": " Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?"}
{"prompt": "The records are not the picture.\nWanda:", "completion": " Pietro."}
{"prompt": "We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just... sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...\nWanda:", "completion": " Stark."}
{"prompt": "We were trapped for two days.\nWanda:", "completion": " Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, \"This will set it off.\" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us."}
{"prompt": "He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.\nSteve:", "completion": " Fatalities?"}
{"prompt": "Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.\nSteve:", "completion": " Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common."}
{"prompt": "That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am.\nSteve:", "completion": " Barton, we might have something."}
{"prompt": "Gotta go.\nSteve:", "completion": " Who was that?"}
{"prompt": "Girlfriend.\nTony:", "completion": " What's this?"}
{"prompt": "What's this?\nSteve:", "completion": " A message. Ultron killed Strucker."}
{"prompt": "A message. Ultron killed Strucker.\nTony:", "completion": " And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us."}
{"prompt": "And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?"}
{"prompt": "This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?\nSteve:", "completion": " Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss."}
{"prompt": "Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Yeah, I bet he... Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I bet he... Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.\nTony:", "completion": " Not everything."}
{"prompt": "Not everything.\nSteve:", "completion": " Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends."}
{"prompt": "Well, these people are all horrible.\nTony:", "completion": " Wait. I know that guy. From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very \"Ahab.\""}
{"prompt": "Wait. I know that guy. From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very \"Ahab.\"\nThor:", "completion": " What's this?"}
{"prompt": "What's this?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it..."}
{"prompt": "Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...\nThor:", "completion": " No, those are tattoos, this is a brand."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.\nSteve:", "completion": " What dialect?"}
{"prompt": "Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.\nTony:", "completion": " If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods..."}
{"prompt": "If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...\nSteve:", "completion": " I thought your father said he got the last of it?"}
{"prompt": "I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?\nTony:", "completion": " The strongest metal on earth."}
{"prompt": "The strongest metal on earth.\nSteve:", "completion": " Where is this guy now?"}
{"prompt": "Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. Now, minister, where were we? Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.\nWanda:", "completion": " Everybody's afraid of something."}
{"prompt": "What?! I'm not...! I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is I'm sorry. I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness!\nTony:", "completion": " Ahh, Junior. You're gonna break your old man's heart."}
{"prompt": "If I have to.\nThor:", "completion": " We don't have to break anything."}
{"prompt": "Clearly you've never made an omelet.\nTony:", "completion": " He beat me by one second."}
{"prompt": "Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?\nTony:", "completion": " This was never my life."}
{"prompt": "This was never my life.\nSteve:", "completion": " You two can still walk away from this."}
{"prompt": "You two can still walk away from this.\nWanda:", "completion": " Oh, we will."}
{"prompt": "Oh, we will.\nSteve:", "completion": " I know you've suffered."}
{"prompt": "Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...\nThor:", "completion": " If you believe in peace, then let us keep it."}
{"prompt": "I think you're confusing peace with quiet.\nTony:", "completion": " Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?"}
{"prompt": "Move, move, move!\nSteve:", "completion": " Stay down, kid!"}
{"prompt": "Guys, is this a Code Green?\nSteve:", "completion": " Thor! Status?"}
{"prompt": "Thor! Status?\nThor:", "completion": " The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty."}
{"prompt": "Again.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You'll break them."}
{"prompt": "Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " What if I fail?"}
{"prompt": "Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?\nThor:", "completion": " Heimdall, your eyes?!"}
{"prompt": "The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it!\nThor:", "completion": " I can still save you."}
{"prompt": "Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I have no place in the world."}
{"prompt": "What can I do?\nWanda:", "completion": " Ah, it hurts."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.\nWanda:", "completion": " No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. I want the big one."}
{"prompt": "Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.\nTony:", "completion": " And you're not going anywhere."}
{"prompt": "Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.\nTony:", "completion": " News or footage, keyword: Hulk. Natasha, I could really use a lullaby."}
{"prompt": "Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm calling in VERONICA. Alright everybody, stand down! You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner."}
{"prompt": "I'm calling in VERONICA. Alright everybody, stand down! You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.\nTony:", "completion": " Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. Okay. In the back? Dick move, Banner. VERONICA, gimme a hand. Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. No, not that way, not that way! Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! Everybody out! Going to get ugly! I'm sorry. Damage report. That's comprehensive. Show me something. How quickly can we buy this building?"}
{"prompt": "The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.\nTony:", "completion": " Stark Relief Foundation?"}
{"prompt": "Already on the scene. How's the team?\nTony:", "completion": " Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off."}
{"prompt": "Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.\nTony:", "completion": " So, run and hide?"}
{"prompt": "Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.\nTony:", "completion": " Neither do we. Hey, you wanna switch out?"}
{"prompt": "No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.\nTony:", "completion": " A few hours from where?"}
{"prompt": "A safe house.\nThor:", "completion": " What is this place?"}
{"prompt": "What is this place?\nTony:", "completion": " A safe house?"}
{"prompt": "Hey.\nTony:", "completion": " This is an agent of some kind."}
{"prompt": "Hi, sweetheart! Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...\nTony:", "completion": " These are...smaller agents."}
{"prompt": "Did you bring Auntie Nat?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Why don't you hug her and find out?"}
{"prompt": "Why don't you hug her and find out?\nSteve:", "completion": " Sorry for barging in on you."}
{"prompt": "Sorry for barging in on you.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed."}
{"prompt": "Honey. Ah, I missed you.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " How's little Natasha, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Traitor.\nSteve:", "completion": " Thor."}
{"prompt": "Thor.\nThor:", "completion": " I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here."}
{"prompt": "I didn't realize you were waiting.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time."}
{"prompt": "They used up all the hot water.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I should've joined you."}
{"prompt": "Missed our window.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Did we?"}
{"prompt": "The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake..."}
{"prompt": "What did you dream?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me."}
{"prompt": "I think you're being hard on yourself.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Here I was hoping that was your job."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want."}
{"prompt": "Are you out of your mind?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I want you to understand that I'm..."}
{"prompt": "Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " You're not a threat to me."}
{"prompt": "You sure? Even if I didn't just... there's no future with me. I can't ever... I can't have this, kids. Do the math, I physically can't.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. You still think you're the only monster on the team?"}
{"prompt": "What, so we disappear?\nTony:", "completion": " Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?"}
{"prompt": "Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?\nSteve:", "completion": " Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception."}

{"prompt": "So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?\nTony:", "completion": " No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone."}

Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.

{"prompt": "Because you murdered half the planet.\nThanos:", "completion": " A small price to pay for salvation."}
{"prompt": "You're insane.\nThanos:", "completion": " Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction-"}
{"prompt": "YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.\nThanos:", "completion": " I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter."}
{"prompt": "I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.\nThanos:", "completion": " And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry I disappointed you.\nThanos:", "completion": " I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it."}
{"prompt": "I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.\nThanos:", "completion": " But because you did. And you lied."}
{"prompt": "Don't do this.\nThanos:", "completion": " Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."}
{"prompt": "Please don't do this.\nThanos:", "completion": " And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk."}
{"prompt": "He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.\nThanos:", "completion": " You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?"}

{"prompt": "You speak Groot?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."}
{"prompt": "I am Groot.\nThor:", "completion": " You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome."}
{"prompt": "Okay, time to be the captain. So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.\nThor:", "completion": " Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."}

{"prompt": "Still got a mom, though?\nThor:", "completion": " Killed by a dark elf."}
{"prompt": "A best friend?\nThor:", "completion": " Stabbed through the heart."}
{"prompt": "Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?\nThor:", "completion": " Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...he's the toughest there is.\nThor:", "completion": " Well, he's never fought me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, he has!\nThor:", "completion": " He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget."}
{"prompt": "Better be some hammer.\nThor:", "completion": " You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."}
{"prompt": "And what if you're wrong?\nThor:", "completion": " If I'm wrong then...what more could I lose?"}
{"prompt": "I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.\nThor:", "completion": " What's this?"}
{"prompt": "What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.\nThor:", "completion": " He gave you his eye?"}
{"prompt": "He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.\nThor:", "completion": " Thank you, sweet rabbit."}
{"prompt": "Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!\nThor:", "completion": " I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark."}
{"prompt": "It ain't the eye.\nThor:", "completion": " Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen."}
{"prompt": "I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.\nThor:", "completion": " This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...."}
{"prompt": "You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes. Why?"}
{"prompt": "I am Groot.\nThor:", "completion": " Go back to the pod."}
{"prompt": "Go back to the pod.\nThor:", "completion": " Eitri, wait! Stop!"}
{"prompt": "Thor?\nThor:", "completion": " What happened here?"}
{"prompt": "You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!\nThor:", "completion": " Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do?"}
{"prompt": "300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.'\nThor:", "completion": " Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head."}
{"prompt": "Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head.\nThor:", "completion": " Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."}
{"prompt": "Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.\nPeter:", "completion": " Hey, what's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, what's going on?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " I think we're here."}

{"prompt": "Yep, got it.\nTony:", "completion": " This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."}
{"prompt": "This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.\nPeter:", "completion": " Okay. Okay. Ready."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Okay. Ready.\nPeter:", "completion": " We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!"}
{"prompt": "We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!\nTony:", "completion": " You alright? That was close. I owe you one."}
{"prompt": "You alright? That was close. I owe you one.\nPeter:", "completion": " Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry."}

{"prompt": "Thank you, sir. Captain Rogers.\nSteve:", "completion": " Neighbor."}
{"prompt": "Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.\nSteve:", "completion": " Sir, it's an honor."}
{"prompt": "The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, \"No, we'll negotiate.\" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.\nSteve:", "completion": " So you gave him a promotion."}
{"prompt": "I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?\nSteve:", "completion": " I don't know."}
{"prompt": "You know it was bugged?\nSteve:", "completion": " I did, because Nick told me."}
{"prompt": "Who hired you, Batroc?\nSteve:", "completion": " Is that live?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.\nSteve:", "completion": " Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line."}
{"prompt": "No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.\nSteve:", "completion": " Am I supposed to know who that is?"}
{"prompt": "Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.\nSteve:", "completion": " Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?"}
{"prompt": "The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.\nSteve:", "completion": " If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true."}
{"prompt": "Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?\nSteve:", "completion": " He told me not to trust anyone."}
{"prompt": "I wonder if that included him.\nSteve:", "completion": " I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me."}
{"prompt": "Captain. Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.\nSteve:", "completion": " Understood."}
{"prompt": "Understood.\nSteve:", "completion": " Operations control."}
{"prompt": "Cap.\nSteve:", "completion": " Rumlow."}
{"prompt": "Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?\nSteve:", "completion": " No, lets wait and see what it is first."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.\nSteve:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Confirmed.\nSteve:", "completion": " Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?"}
{"prompt": "Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal.\nSteve:", "completion": " It kind of feels personal."}
{"prompt": "Because he lied to us. Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.\nSteve:", "completion": " Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "Where is it?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Safe."}
{"prompt": "Safe.\nSteve:", "completion": " Do better!"}
{"prompt": "Do better!\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Where did you get it?"}
{"prompt": "Where did you get it?\nSteve:", "completion": " Why would I tell you?"}
{"prompt": "Why would I tell you?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Fury gave it to you. Why?"}
{"prompt": "Fury gave it to you. Why?\nSteve:", "completion": " What's on it?"}
{"prompt": "What's on it?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I don't know."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.\nSteve:", "completion": " Stop lying!"}
{"prompt": "Stop lying!\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I only act like I know everything, Rogers."}
{"prompt": "I only act like I know everything, Rogers.\nSteve:", "completion": " I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you."}
{"prompt": "Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\nSteve:", "completion": " I'm not gonna ask you again."}
{"prompt": "I'm not gonna ask you again.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years."}
{"prompt": "I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.\nSteve:", "completion": " So he's a ghost story."}
{"prompt": "So he's a ghost story.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis."}

{"prompt": "We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk."}

{"prompt": "How much time do we have?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Uh...about nine minutes from... Now. Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands."}
{"prompt": "Uh...about nine minutes from... Now. Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.\nSteve:", "completion": " Can you override it?"}
{"prompt": "Can you override it?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from."}
{"prompt": "Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going?\nSteve:", "completion": " New Jersey."}
{"prompt": "Oh. I have the exact same glasses.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Wow, you two are practically twins."}

{"prompt": "Shh, relax. Got it. You know it?\nSteve:", "completion": " I used to. Let's go. Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro."}

{"prompt": "First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.\nSteve:", "completion": " How did you get here?"}
{"prompt": "Invited.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value."}

{"prompt": "Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.\nSteve:", "completion": " Prove it."}
{"prompt": "Accessing archive. HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you."}
{"prompt": "Accidents will happen. HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. As I was saying...\nSteve:", "completion": " What's on this drive?"}
{"prompt": "Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " What kind of algorithm? What does it do?"}

{"prompt": "The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.\nSteve:", "completion": " Shouldn't be a problem."}

{"prompt": "Never heard of it.\nSteve:", "completion": " What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?"}
{"prompt": "I was throwing up, I get seasick. Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.\nSteve:", "completion": " You're right. It's not. It's hers."}

{"prompt": "How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.\nSteve:", "completion": " And what then?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.\nSteve:", "completion": " What then?!"}

{"prompt": "Sergeant Barnes...\nSteve:", "completion": " Bucky, no!"}

You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not."}

{"prompt": "Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.\nFury:", "completion": " No, I have the courage not to."}

You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?"}

{"prompt": "That agent, that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us...\nFury:", "completion": " Coulson. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet."}
{"prompt": "Coulson. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yeah well, give him time."}
{"prompt": "Yeah well, give him time.\nFury:", "completion": " I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human."}
{"prompt": "I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I get in trouble for that. A lot."}
{"prompt": "I get in trouble for that. A lot.\nFury:", "completion": " I see that about you . Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure."}
{"prompt": "I see that about you . Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine."}
{"prompt": "Maintain the course for C-53.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau."}
{"prompt": "Aunty Carol? Mom, it's Aunty Carol! I knew it, everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'm not really who you think I am."}
{"prompt": "Green-transforming aliens? There's no such thing.\nFury:", "completion": " You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves."}
{"prompt": "You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You don't believe me."}
{"prompt": "No way. That's so cool.\nFury:", "completion": " Oh, ho. She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands."}
{"prompt": "You want to give her a hand with that?\nFury:", "completion": " Mmm??"}
{"prompt": "You don't remember anything?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I see... flashes. Little moments, but I can't tell what's real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it'll all make sense?"}
{"prompt": "You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn't about to argue, 'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Since when is a shortcut cheating?"}
{"prompt": "Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I definitely don't remember those."}
{"prompt": "Mmm, of course you don't. When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said 'she had lives to save'. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said...\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " 'If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.'"}
{"prompt": "Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we've both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That's why I liked her. But, now you're saying she's from another planet.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I know this must be hard for you."}
{"prompt": "What, this part right here? No, no. Know what's hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don't even know what... 'Vers'? Is that really who you are now?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I don't know."}
{"prompt": "That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Don't answer that."}
{"prompt": "It's just my neighbor.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " They can change into anyone."}
{"prompt": "Hi there.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here's no joke. I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you'd mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " A closer looksie?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " To see the bird parked out by the road. You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you Talos?"}
{"prompt": "No one's gonna hurt the girl. Just, don't kill me. That would really complicate the situation.\nFury:", "completion": " I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " And who is that, out there?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, that's a fair point. But I'm sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles."}
{"prompt": "Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it'll be worth your while.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen."}
{"prompt": "Oh my God! Get that thing away! How'd that get in here?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " The cat? This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?"}
{"prompt": "That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.\nFury:", "completion": " A Flerken?"}
{"prompt": "Why can't I listen to?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " What's happening?"}
{"prompt": "What's happening?\nFury:", "completion": " It's loading."}
{"prompt": "Go Carol. Fly!\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " That's no MIG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?"}
{"prompt": "Those are the bad guys. Fly faster, now.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yes, ma'am. What do they want?"}
{"prompt": "Me. My work. I never should have brought you along.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Here come some G's. . They're firing backward. Hold on!"}
{"prompt": "Danvers, do you copy?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yeah, I copy. We hit ground."}
{"prompt": "Can anyone hear me?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yeah. I copy! Doc?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I copy! Doc?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Your blood... it's blue."}
{"prompt": "I have to destroy it before they get here.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " What? Lawson?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell and I come from a planet called Hala.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue."}
{"prompt": "Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You've got to save them without me.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Save who? How?"}
{"prompt": "We have no interest in hurting you.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!"}
{"prompt": "The energy core, where is it?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded."}
{"prompt": "Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " No wait. You mean that energy core?"}
{"prompt": "She absorbed its power. She's coming with us.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " He lied to me."}
{"prompt": "He lied to me.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Everything that I knew was a lie."}
{"prompt": "Now you understand.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " What? What do I understand now?"}
{"prompt": "Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa."}
{"prompt": "She wanted you to help us find the core.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Well, I already destroyed it."}
{"prompt": "No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates, we can find it.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You'll use it to destroy us."}
{"prompt": "We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now? You're not one of them.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. I don't even know who I am!"}
{"prompt": "I know I don't deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell's core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors."}
{"prompt": "Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors.\nFury:", "completion": " Orbital positioning and velocity."}
{"prompt": "You didn't find her lab on Earth, because it's not on Earth.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we'll find it, in orbit, right now."}
{"prompt": "In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you're my science guy, right?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon. We've got to get the core before he does."}
{"prompt": "Mmm. You're going to space?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " In what?"}
{"prompt": "A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications.\nFury:", "completion": " Hmm. Your science guy."}
{"prompt": "Hmm. Your science guy.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Well, I could use a co-pilot."}
{"prompt": "You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you're setting for your daughter.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Your Mom's lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble."}
{"prompt": "You remember.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Is that mine? . No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can't wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you're obviously the only person around here with any sense of style..."}
{"prompt": "Definitely not.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Well, since we're on the same team..."}
{"prompt": "Well, since we're on the same team...\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " How do I look?"}
{"prompt": "Fresh.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " What took you so long?"}
{"prompt": "I'm fine. Thanks for asking.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " PRY46-B..."}
{"prompt": "No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we've learned.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Okay, then let's do this."}
{"prompt": "Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " The person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who."}
{"prompt": "And what is your earliest memory of Hala?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins."}
{"prompt": "Whose blood?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Hmm."}
{"prompt": "For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Passing 500 and climbing."}
{"prompt": "You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.\nFury:", "completion": " Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out like that, yeah I'm gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?"}
{"prompt": "Physiologically, yeah. But it takes practice and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.\nFury:", "completion": " Can you turn into a cat?"}
{"prompt": "Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?\nFury:", "completion": " A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap."}
{"prompt": "A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks."}
{"prompt": "Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks.\nFury:", "completion": " Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?"}
{"prompt": "Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Pretty much."}
{"prompt": "Pretty much.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Locking in coordinate grid."}
{"prompt": "It's here. It's gotta be here.\nFury:", "completion": " Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?"}
{"prompt": "Is that it? The core?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " In her notes, she called it the Tesseract."}
{"prompt": "Talos!\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " He didn't come here for the Tesseract."}
{"prompt": "It's okay, it's okay. She's alright. She's a friend.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'm not gonna hurt you."}
{"prompt": "She led me to you.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'm so sorry. I didn't know."}
{"prompt": "Carol, this is war. My hands are filthy from it too. But we're here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There's thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy.\nFury:", "completion": " If I played the same pinball machine for six years I'd have some high scores too."}
{"prompt": "And the core?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You lied to me."}
{"prompt": "The music, it's a nice touch.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Let... me... out."}
{"prompt": "No can do.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground."}
{"prompt": "With what exactly? Your powers came from us.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You didn't give me these powers. The blast did."}
{"prompt": "Species: Flerken. Threat: High.\nFury:", "completion": " It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter."}
{"prompt": "Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.\nFury:", "completion": " That thing is clearly busted."}
{"prompt": "You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You're talking about destroying them because they won't submit to your rule. And neither will I."}
{"prompt": "We found you. We embraced you as our own.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends."}
{"prompt": "Without us... you're only human.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You're right. I'm only human."}
{"prompt": "On Hala, you were reborn. Vers.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " My name... is Carol."}
{"prompt": "She's trying to break out.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens... ...when I'm finally set free?"}
{"prompt": "I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens... ...when I'm finally set free?\nFury:", "completion": " You know you're glowing, right?"}
{"prompt": "You know you're glowing, right?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'll explain it later. Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox."}
{"prompt": "I'll explain it later. Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox.\nFury:", "completion": " Me?"}
{"prompt": "Me?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Yes."}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nFury:", "completion": " I'm not touching that thing."}
{"prompt": "I'm not touching that thing.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Want me to get you an oven mitt?"}
{"prompt": "Want me to get you an oven mitt?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you."}
{"prompt": "What about you?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'll buy you some time!"}
{"prompt": "I'll buy you some time!\nFury:", "completion": " I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me."}
{"prompt": "I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Hey Guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nFury:", "completion": " Good kitty."}
{"prompt": "Good kitty.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out?"}
{"prompt": "Don't make me do this.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nFury:", "completion": " Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side."}
{"prompt": "Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing?\nFury:", "completion": " Flerken kitty ate it."}
{"prompt": "Nice diversion.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I could've swore, I put it in there."}
{"prompt": "On it.\nFury:", "completion": " You all right, friend?"}
{"prompt": "We've got a bogey. Coming in hot.\nFury:", "completion": " Ha ha!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! Boom!\nFury:", "completion": " What the hell was that?"}
{"prompt": "I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will it get the better of you, as always? I always told you... you'll be ready, the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show, and prove, prove to me, you can beat me without...\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I have nothing to prove to you."}
{"prompt": "I can't go back empty-handed.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " You won't be empty-handed. I'm sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it. The war, the lies, all of it."}
{"prompt": "You can't do this.\nFury:", "completion": " That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? The bad guy's still in there somewhere- Oh! MOTHER FLERKEN!!!"}
{"prompt": "You okay?\nFury:", "completion": " Yeah. It's just a scratch."}
{"prompt": "No...\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I can't believe you got into the raddest dogfight ever."}
{"prompt": "I'd say you arrived just in time.\nFury:", "completion": " That's some nifty flying you did out there. SHIELD could always use a good pilot like you."}
{"prompt": "I'll consider it. As long as you don't call my flying nifty again. How's your eye?\nFury:", "completion": " Getting better every second."}
{"prompt": "Getting better every second.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Just so I'm clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?"}
{"prompt": "Just so I'm clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?\nFury:", "completion": " Keller. Tied my boss up, stole his identity."}
{"prompt": "Whose side are you on?\nFury:", "completion": " You're good to go here til you recover, but you and your family will need a new look."}
{"prompt": "I could go back to being your boss.\nFury:", "completion": " Please don't."}
{"prompt": "No way, you guys have the best eyes. Don't ever change your eyes.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started."}
{"prompt": "They won't be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol is right. They need their own home.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I'll be back before you know it."}
{"prompt": "Maybe I can fly up and meet you halfway.\nFury:", "completion": " Only if you learn to glow, like your Auntie Carol."}
{"prompt": "Or maybe I'll build a spaceship. You don't know.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " He doesn't."}
{"prompt": "He doesn't.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden."}
{"prompt": "Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden.\nFury:", "completion": " You're sure that's what Marvel would want?"}
{"prompt": "You're sure that's what Marvel would want?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Mar-Vell."}
{"prompt": "Mar-Vell.\nFury:", "completion": " That's what I said."}
{"prompt": "That's what I said.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " It's two words. Mar-Vell."}
{"prompt": "Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least."}
{"prompt": "I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least.\nFury:", "completion": " What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?"}
{"prompt": "What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " For emergencies only. Okay?"}
{"prompt": "For emergencies only. Okay?\nFury:", "completion": " Well, if you're ever passing back through this galaxy, be sure to give a brother a shout."}
{"prompt": "We got the ketchup stain off.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble. It's hard for me to say goodbye, too."}
{"prompt": "So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out because you refused to give them the Tesseract?\nFury:", "completion": " I'll neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story."}
{"prompt": "Understood. I'm sorry to report that we still haven't found the Tesseract.\nFury:", "completion": " I'm sure it will turn up somewhere."}
{"prompt": "I'll let you know when it does.\nFury:", "completion": " Then what?"}
{"prompt": "Sir?\nFury:", "completion": " We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe. SHIELD alone can't protect us. We need to find more."}
{"prompt": "More weapons?\nFury:", "completion": " More heroes."}
{"prompt": "You think we can find others like her?\nFury:", "completion": " We found her and we weren't even looking."}
{"prompt": "Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make.\nSteve:", "completion": " This is a nightmare."}
{"prompt": "This is a nightmare.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " I've had better nightmares."}
{"prompt": "Hey. So that thing just stopped doing whatever the hell it was doing.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " What have we got?"}
{"prompt": "Whatever the signal is sending, it finally creeped off.\nSteve:", "completion": " I thought we bypassed the battery."}
{"prompt": "We did. It's still plugged in, it just... it just stopped.\nSteve:", "completion": " Reboot and send the signal again."}
{"prompt": "Reboot and send the signal again.\nBruce Banner:", "completion": " We don't even know what this is."}
{"prompt": "We don't even know what this is.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I want to know who's on the other end of that thing."}
{"prompt": "Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I want to know who's on the other end of that thing.\nCaptain Marvel:", "completion": " Where's Fury?"}
{"prompt": "''\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Challenge round, Billy."}
{"prompt": "Heheh. No, doctor.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977. Seriously, Billy, you said this one would be hard."}
{"prompt": "Where do you store all this useless information?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn. Status, Billy?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you. '''' Image status, STAT.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " We do not have time for that."}
{"prompt": "Nick is a great doctor.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " You came to me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one."}
{"prompt": "What?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust."}
{"prompt": "Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Oh really?"}
{"prompt": "Another speaking engagement? So romantic.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " You used to love going to those things with me. We had fun together."}
{"prompt": "Stephen. Everything is about you.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique."}
{"prompt": "''''\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Billy! What have you got for me?"}
{"prompt": "I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not."}
{"prompt": "They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. Golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " What did they do?!?"}
{"prompt": "11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments. Severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Look at these fixators."}
{"prompt": "No one could have done better.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " I could have done better."}
{"prompt": "One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair. He came in 3 times a week. But one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " He walked?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, he walked.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Bullshit. Show me his file."}
{"prompt": "And this is the part where you apologize.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " This is the part where you leave."}
{"prompt": "You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " They really should put the warnings before that stuff."}
{"prompt": "What you just did takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " And yet, my hands still shake."}
{"prompt": "- For now, yes.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Not forever?"}
{"prompt": "The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " From what?"}
{"prompt": "Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Like Dormammu?"}
{"prompt": "Where did you learn that name?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?"}
{"prompt": "No!!!\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Wong? Mordo?"}
{"prompt": "Tell me, Mr. Doctor.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange."}
{"prompt": "You are a doctor?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yes."}
{"prompt": "The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " What about the people you killed?"}
{"prompt": "Sir, can I help you?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Dr. Palmer, where is she?"}
{"prompt": "- At the nurses station.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Christine!"}
{"prompt": "What happened?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade."}
{"prompt": "Stephen! Stephen!\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle."}
{"prompt": "Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " My astral body."}
{"prompt": "Are you dead?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " No, Christine, but I am dying."}
{"prompt": "Stephen, come on.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Hit me again!"}
{"prompt": "Stop doing that!\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Up the voltage and hit me again."}
{"prompt": "No, your heart is beating!\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Just do it!"}
{"prompt": "After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded."}
{"prompt": "Why would I?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more."}
{"prompt": "Kathmandu?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "This is insane.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Just tell me the truth?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet."}
{"prompt": "- Kaecilius?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will."}
{"prompt": "He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "How many more?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Two. I stranded one in the desert."}
{"prompt": "And the other?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer."}
{"prompt": "You become a doctor to save one life above all others: your own.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Still seeing through me, are you?"}
{"prompt": "Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Because you might not like them?"}
{"prompt": "These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " What do you think I just did?"}
{"prompt": "You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " When you would have done it so easily?"}
{"prompt": "There is no other way.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " You lack imagination."}
{"prompt": "That is hilarious.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " This was a mistake."}
{"prompt": "Liar.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Christine!!!"}
{"prompt": "Do you wonder what I see in your future?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " No. Yes."}
{"prompt": "Constantly. He had a choice: to return to to his own life, or to serve something greater than himself.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?"}
{"prompt": "Because there are other ways to save lives.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " A harder way."}
{"prompt": "Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile, dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " She did what she thought was right."}
{"prompt": "No.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Spells working. We got a second chance."}
{"prompt": "You cannot do this forever.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Actually, I can. This is how things are now: you and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly."}
{"prompt": "Then you will spend eternity dying.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live."}
{"prompt": "What have you done?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " I made a bargain."}
{"prompt": "Mid-Credits Scene\nThor:", "completion": " So, Earth has wizards now, huh?"}
{"prompt": "So, Earth has wizards now, huh?\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Tea?"}
{"prompt": "What do you drink?\nThor:", "completion": " Not tea."}
{"prompt": "Not tea.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings."}
{"prompt": "So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.\nThor:", "completion": " A worthy inclusion."}
{"prompt": "A worthy inclusion.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, yes. Probably.\nDoctor Strange:", "completion": " Alright. Let me help you."}
{"prompt": "Drop it, now!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, cool, man. No problem. No problem at all."}
{"prompt": "What is your name?!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude, chill out."}
{"prompt": "Move!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Why?"}
{"prompt": "Who?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys?"}
{"prompt": "Move!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Ah, forget this."}
{"prompt": "Quill?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, Yondu."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Quill\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Broker. The orb. As commissioned."}
{"prompt": "A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is wiped from existence!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Woh. Come on!"}
{"prompt": "Farewell, Mr. Quill.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, we had a deal, bro!"}
{"prompt": "What happened?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Uh...this guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord."}
{"prompt": "You have the bearing of a man of honor.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it's not something I would ever say about myself."}
{"prompt": "Fool. You should have learned.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I don't learn. One of my issues. What the..."}
{"prompt": "Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Star-Lord."}
{"prompt": "Oh, sorry. Lord. I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. He's got a code name.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Come on, man. It's a...it's an outlaw name."}
{"prompt": "I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel. But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long. I've escaped 22 prisons, this one's no different. You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now, and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon."}
{"prompt": "What's a raccoon?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " \"What's a raccoon?\" It's what you are, stupid."}
{"prompt": "Ain't no thing like me, 'cept me.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So, this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is it?"}
{"prompt": "I am Groot.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So what? What's the Orb?"}
{"prompt": "Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. Yeah, I know who you are. Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, we know who you are. Who is she? Yeah, you said that."}
{"prompt": "I only ask that you take this matter seriously.\nThanos:", "completion": " The only matter I did not take seriously, boy..."}
{"prompt": "The only matter I did not take seriously, boy...\nThanos:", "completion": " ...is you."}
{"prompt": "...is you.\nThanos:", "completion": " Your politics bore me!"}
{"prompt": "Your politics bore me!\nThanos:", "completion": " Your demeanor is that of a pouty child."}
{"prompt": "Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.\nThanos:", "completion": " And, apparently...you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora."}
{"prompt": "And, apparently...you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.\nThanos:", "completion": " I shall honor our agreement, Kree."}
{"prompt": "I shall honor our agreement, Kree.\nThanos:", "completion": " If you bring me the Orb."}
{"prompt": "But return to me again empty-handed...\nThanos:", "completion": " ...and I will bathe the starways in your blood."}
{"prompt": "Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one."}
{"prompt": "Do not ever call me a thesaurus.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's just a metaphor, dude."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Those are some big guns."}
{"prompt": "I told you I had a plan.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " That was a pretty good plan. Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner."}
{"prompt": "The orb's there. Let's go!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Wait, wait, wait."}
{"prompt": "What?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " That bastard didn't put it back."}
{"prompt": "Put what back?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Here. Get them to the ship, I will be right back."}
{"prompt": "How are you gonna possibly...\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go!"}
{"prompt": "Behold. This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan. Companion, what were you retrieving? You're an imbecile.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Woh, woh, woh! Yoh, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can't take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is this?"}
{"prompt": "Don't touch that, it's a bomb.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " A bomb?"}
{"prompt": "Yep.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " And you leave it lying around?"}
{"prompt": "I was gonna put it in a box.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What's a box gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "How about this one?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No! Woh! Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!"}
{"prompt": "Why? What is it?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Shut up."}
{"prompt": "Hey!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What is that?"}
{"prompt": "You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates."}
{"prompt": "We're heading in the right direction, for now.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " If we're gonna work together, you might want to try trusting me a little bit."}
{"prompt": "And how much do you trust me?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon."}
{"prompt": "I am not a princess!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money."}
{"prompt": "I have no interest in money.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Great. That means more money for the three of us. For the four of us. Partners."}
{"prompt": "We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I'll tell the buyer we're on our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Oh, she has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting."}
{"prompt": "Heads up! We're inbound.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Woh."}
{"prompt": "It's called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent. There are no regulations whatsoever here. Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull. The bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy. It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde and John Stamos."}
{"prompt": "It sounds like a place which I would like to visit.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, you should."}
{"prompt": "Excuse me.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Watch your wallets."}
{"prompt": "That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this job."}
{"prompt": "My connection is making us wait.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, \"Stab, stab. Those are my terms.\""}
{"prompt": "My father didn't stress diplomacy.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Thanos?"}
{"prompt": "He's not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan, I...I couldn't stand by and... Why would you risk your life for this?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " My mother gave it to me. My mom liked to share with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up. I happened to have it on me when I was...the day that she... You know, when I left Earth."}
{"prompt": "What do you do with it?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance."}
{"prompt": "I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Really? Well, on my planet, there's a legend about people like you. It's called \"Footloose.\" And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...it's the greatest thing there is."}
{"prompt": "Who put the sticks up their butts?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What? No, that's just a..."}
{"prompt": "That is cruel.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's just a phrase people use."}
{"prompt": "The melody is pleasant! No!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Ow! What the hell?"}
{"prompt": "I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...your pelvic sorcery!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " That is not what is happening here. Oh, no."}
{"prompt": "Stop it!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Woh! Woh! What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "That is also true!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hold on! Hold on!"}
{"prompt": "Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Rocket, you're drunk. Alright? No one's laughing at you."}
{"prompt": "He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does! Well, I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn apart, and put back together, over and over and turned into some...some little monster!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Rocket, no one's calling you a monster."}
{"prompt": "He called me vermin! She called me rodent! Let's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you're rich."}
{"prompt": "Fine. But I can't promise when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!"}
{"prompt": "We have traveled halfway across the quadrant, and Ronan is no closer to being dead.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Drax!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe. These carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " There's a little pee coming out of me right now."}
{"prompt": "No!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What the fff...?"}
{"prompt": "What do you still have it for?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Well what are we gonna do, leave it in there?"}
{"prompt": "I can't believe you had that in your purse!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!"}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps! Just give it to Ronan!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So he can destroy the galaxy?"}
{"prompt": "What are you, some Saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!"}
{"prompt": "Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the stone to fall into Ronan's hands. We have to go back to your ship and deliver it to Nova.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Right, right, okay. I think you're right. Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us, who's really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view."}
{"prompt": "You're despicable.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I..."}
{"prompt": "At last! Ha-ha-ha! I shall meet my foe and destroy him!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You called Ronan?!"}
{"prompt": "The stone is in the furthest pod. Bring it down!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano."}
{"prompt": "How? We've got no weaponry on these things.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " These pods are industrial grade, they're nearly indestructible."}
{"prompt": "Not against Necroblasts, they're not.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " That's not what I'm saying."}
{"prompt": "Oh!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Let me borrow your ride."}
{"prompt": "Quill, I'm trapped! I can't make it to the Milano, I have to head out.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What? Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there."}
{"prompt": "Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there's nothing we can do for her. These pods aren't meant to be out here. In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Aw, damn it!"}
{"prompt": "Quill?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yondu! Yondu! This is Quill! My coordinates are 2-2-7-K-3-2-4."}
{"prompt": "Quill? Quill, what are you doing?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Just outside Knowhere. If you're there, come get me. I'm all yours."}
{"prompt": "Quill? What happened?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I saw you out there. I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't let you die. I found something inside of myself. Something incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but objectively..."}
{"prompt": "Where's the orb?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's...well, they got the orb."}
{"prompt": "The orb is in my possession, as I promised.\nThanos:", "completion": " Bring it to me."}
{"prompt": "Yes, that was our agreement. Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.\nThanos:", "completion": " Boy, I would reconsider your current course."}
{"prompt": "When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I saved your life!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Oh, will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you've been throwing that in my face, like it's some great thing, not eating me! Normal people don't even think about eating someone else! Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my home and from my family."}
{"prompt": "Captain's gotta teach stuff!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen."}
{"prompt": "The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We got a ringer."}
{"prompt": "Is that right?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army."}
{"prompt": "He's vulnerable.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh? Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days."}
{"prompt": "I'm giving you to the count of five. Five, four, three...\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No!"}
{"prompt": "No, no! Don't!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No! Wait, hold on! Rocket, it's me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We're fine!"}
{"prompt": "Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on? You call that \"figured it out\"? We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Oh, you want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?"}
{"prompt": "We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?"}
{"prompt": "So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We'll figure that part out later."}
{"prompt": "How?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I have a plan."}
{"prompt": "You've got a plan?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yes."}
{"prompt": "First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No, I'm not. People say that all the time, it's not that unique of a thing to say."}
{"prompt": "Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I have part of a plan!"}
{"prompt": "I just saved Quill.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me."}
{"prompt": "When did we establish it?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Like three seconds ago!"}
{"prompt": "She's right, you don't get an opinion. What percentage?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I don't know, twelve percent."}
{"prompt": "Twelve percent?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " That's a fake laugh."}
{"prompt": "It's real!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Totally fake."}
{"prompt": "It's barely a concept.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You're taking their side?"}
{"prompt": "So what, it's better than eleven percent? What the hell does that have to do with anything?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue. Guys. Come on. Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around at us, you know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we have. All of us. Our homes, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more than it gives, but not today. Today, it's given us something. It has given us a chance."}
{"prompt": "To do what?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " To give a shit. For once, not run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives."}
{"prompt": "But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it's impossible. You're asking us to die.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, I guess I am. I..."}
{"prompt": "The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " All Ronan's gotta do is touch the stone to the planet's surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova Corps."}
{"prompt": "Everything will die.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So Ronan does not make the surface. Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster's starboard hull. Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter."}
{"prompt": "Once they know we're on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We'll make it to the flight deck, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan."}
{"prompt": "Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone. Use these devices to contain it. If you touch it, it will kill you.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help."}
{"prompt": "There's one more thing we need to complete the plan. That guy's eye...\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No! No, we don't. No, we don't need that guy's eye."}
{"prompt": "This is a terrible plan.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends."}
{"prompt": "Fire! Cover it down! Submerge!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Rocket, hurry!"}
{"prompt": "Peter Quill, this is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you here.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " They got my \"dick\" message!"}
{"prompt": "I can barely see. When did you learn to do that?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'm pretty sure the answer is \"I am Groot.\""}
{"prompt": "I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Star-Lord.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Finally! You thief!"}
{"prompt": "Finger to the throat means death. Metaphor.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, sorta. Oh, no."}
{"prompt": "Hold on, Saal, just... Quill, you gotta hurry. The city's been evacuated, but we're getting our asses kicked down here.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Gamora hasn't opened the door!"}
{"prompt": "\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " \"Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter.\" Listen to these words. \"Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter.\" Now bring it down hard! \"Some day, we'll get it together and we'll get it...\""}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Dance-off, bro. Me and you. Gamora. Subtle. Take it back."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom."}
{"prompt": "Take my hand, Peter.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Mom."}
{"prompt": "YOU'RE MORTAL! HOW!?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You said it yourself, bitch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy."}
{"prompt": "Peter, you can't. Peter.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to, but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps."}
{"prompt": "I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain't one. Hand it over, son.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yondu. Do not open that orb. You know that, right? You've seen what it does to people."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, that guy was a jackass.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " He's gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the orb on him."}
{"prompt": "He was gonna kill you, Peter.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Oh, I know. But he was about the only family I had."}
{"prompt": "No. He wasn't.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Why would you even know this?"}
{"prompt": "When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'm not Terran?"}
{"prompt": "Your friends have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Thank you, Nova Prime."}
{"prompt": "Hmm.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " They'll be fine, Dey. I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em."}
{"prompt": "You?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah, me."}
{"prompt": "Peter, I know these last few months have been hard for you. But I'm going to a better place and I will be okay. And I will always be with you. You are the light of my life. My precious son. My little Star-Lord. Love, mom.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?"}
{"prompt": "We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Bit of both!"}
{"prompt": "Which it will be its last.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I thought your thing was a sword?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, ok, sure Quill\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No, seriously, I side with Drax."}
{"prompt": "I tried telling him that!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Skin has the same level of thickness on the inside as it is on the outside!"}
{"prompt": "Yes! I have single-handily vanquished the beast! What? What are they called again?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Anulax batteries."}
{"prompt": "Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries. Do with her as you please.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha."}
{"prompt": "What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " My mother is from Earth."}
{"prompt": "Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Damn shadow."}
{"prompt": "I first met my beloved at a war rally.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Oh, God."}
{"prompt": "Exactly.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I was being sarcastic!"}
{"prompt": "Can your bickering on a hold until after we survive this massive space battle?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " More incoming!"}
{"prompt": "I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!"}
{"prompt": "We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Our weapons are down."}
{"prompt": "Look at this! Where is the other half of our ship?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " My ship."}
{"prompt": "Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'm not gonna answer to \"Star-Munch.\""}
{"prompt": "I did it because I wanted to!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Dick."}
{"prompt": "Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon."}
{"prompt": "Don't call me a racoon!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I'm sorry. I took it too far. I meant trash panda."}
{"prompt": "I don't know.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " It's worse. It's so much worse."}
{"prompt": "Eat you?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What was that story you once told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Who?"}
{"prompt": "He owned a magic boat?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " David Hasselhoff?"}
{"prompt": "Right.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Not a magic boat. A talking car."}
{"prompt": "Why did he talk again?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " To help him fight crime, and to be supportive!"}
{"prompt": "I say: if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low, your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Right, and if it's anything other than specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win."}
{"prompt": "If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You read minds?"}
{"prompt": "No. Telepaths know thoughts. Empaths feel feelings, emotions. May I?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Alright."}
{"prompt": "She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Dude, come on! I think you're overreacting a little bit."}
{"prompt": "I have never felt such humor!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So unbelievably uncool."}
{"prompt": "Welcome, everyone, to my world.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Wow. You have your own planet?"}
{"prompt": "Did you make a penis?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Dude!"}
{"prompt": "Oh.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " - Ugh."}
{"prompt": "Give me your hands, son. Here. Hold them like that. Now, close your eyes and concentrate. Take your brain to the center of this planet. Yes!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Whoa!"}
{"prompt": "We are about to do 700!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " So I guess this could all be mine someday."}
{"prompt": "What are you doing, Peter?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Dance with me."}
{"prompt": "You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Again, you made me come here! And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me."}
{"prompt": "You all right, son? I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Mmm-hmm.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "We are beyond such things.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yes."}
{"prompt": "...it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head...\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " ...what?"}
{"prompt": "...IN THE HELL you think you are!?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " YOU KILLED MY MOTHER!"}
{"prompt": "That was being funny!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Not to me!"}
{"prompt": "Got it!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Whoo-hoo!"}
{"prompt": "So, could you?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " A little. I made a ball."}
{"prompt": "A ball?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I thought as hard as I could. It was all that I could come up with."}
{"prompt": "Keep it steady.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " We drill into the center, we kill him!"}
{"prompt": "Well, we got these.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?"}
{"prompt": "Unbelievable. \"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that.\"\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " What a day."}
{"prompt": "NOOO!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hey, you're makin' him nervous!"}
{"prompt": "Shut up and give me some tape! Does anyone have any tape out there?! I wanna put some tape over the death button.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I don't have any tape! Lemme check! Yo, Yondu! Do you have a-- Do you have any tape? Gamora! Do you have any tape? ...TAPE! Ah, never mind! Drax! Do you have any tape?! Yeah! Scotch tape would work! Then why would you ask me if scotch tape would work, if you don't have any?! Nobody has any tape!"}
{"prompt": "Not a single person has tape?!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Nope!"}
{"prompt": "Did you ask Nebula?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Yes!"}
{"prompt": "Are you sure?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " I asked Yondu, and she was standing right next to him!"}
{"prompt": "I knew you were lying!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag! IF ANYBODY'S GONNA HAVE TAPE, IT'S YOU!!"}
{"prompt": "That's exactly my point! I have to do EVERYTHING!!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You are wasting a lot of time here!"}
{"prompt": "Peter! No!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Haha!"}
{"prompt": "What?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " You look like Mary Poppins."}
{"prompt": "Is he cool?\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Hell yeah, he's cool."}
{"prompt": "Ow! My nipples!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Gamora!"}
{"prompt": "YONDU!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " No...No!"}
{"prompt": "No...No!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " NO!"}
{"prompt": "NO!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " Aww, gh...!"}
{"prompt": "Aww, gh...!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " NO! NOOOOOOOOOOO!"}
{"prompt": "NO! NOOOOOOOOOOO!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " OH...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"}
{"prompt": "OH...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " no..."}
{"prompt": "I am Groot.\nStar-Lord:", "completion": " And now I know how Yondu felt."}
{"prompt": "\nTony:", "completion": " I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!"}
{"prompt": "We can talk, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, I see. So it's personal?"}
{"prompt": "No, you intimidate them.\nTony:", "completion": " Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first."}
{"prompt": "I'm an airman.\nTony:", "completion": " Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I have a question to ask.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, please."}
{"prompt": "Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?\nTony:", "completion": " That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right?"}
{"prompt": "Is it cool if I take a picture with you?\nTony:", "completion": " Yes. It's very cool. I don't want to see this on your MySpace page. Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace."}
{"prompt": "Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.\nTony:", "completion": " What's going on?"}
{"prompt": "Contact left!\nTony:", "completion": " What have we got?"}
{"prompt": "Stay down!\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Son of a bitch!\nTony:", "completion": " Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!"}
{"prompt": "Stay here!\nTony:", "completion": " Whoa!"}
{"prompt": "This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working.\nTony:", "completion": " Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning."}
{"prompt": "You are unbelievable.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?"}
{"prompt": "Nobody roped me into anything!\nTony:", "completion": " I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt": "But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.\nTony:", "completion": " Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?"}
{"prompt": "It's right here. Here you go.\nTony:", "completion": " There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, it's okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something. Okay, you, too."}
{"prompt": "I don't blow on a man's dice.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on, honey bear."}
{"prompt": "I don't blow on a man's dice.\nTony:", "completion": " There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And..."}
{"prompt": "That's what happens.\nTony:", "completion": " Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?"}
{"prompt": "This is where I exit.\nTony:", "completion": " All right."}
{"prompt": "Tomorrow, don't be late.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, you can count on it."}
{"prompt": "I'm serious!\nTony:", "completion": " I know, I know. Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go."}
{"prompt": "She's cute.\nTony:", "completion": " She's all right? Hi."}
{"prompt": "Hi.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Okay--"}
{"prompt": "It's okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Go."}
{"prompt": "You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\nTony:", "completion": " Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint."}
{"prompt": "And what do you say to your other nickname? \"The Merchant of Death\"?\nTony:", "completion": " That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?"}
{"prompt": "Brown, actually.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals."}
{"prompt": "You rehearse that much?\nTony:", "completion": " Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime."}
{"prompt": "I can see that.\nTony:", "completion": " I'd like to show you first-hand."}
{"prompt": "All I want is a serious answer.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, \"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\""}
{"prompt": "That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.\nTony:", "completion": " My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero."}
{"prompt": "And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.\nTony:", "completion": " Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey."}
{"prompt": "You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?\nTony:", "completion": " I'd be prepared to lose a few with you."}
{"prompt": "I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?\nTony:", "completion": " Give me an exploded view."}
{"prompt": "The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.\nTony:", "completion": " Log that."}
{"prompt": "I'm gonna try again, right now.\nTony:", "completion": " Please don't turn down my music."}
{"prompt": "I'll keep you posted. You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\nTony:", "completion": " How'd she take it?"}
{"prompt": "Like a champ.\nTony:", "completion": " Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?"}
{"prompt": "Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\nTony:", "completion": " That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there."}
{"prompt": "Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.\nTony:", "completion": " I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?"}
{"prompt": "Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.\nTony:", "completion": " Is it a good representation of his spring period?"}
{"prompt": "Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked--\nTony:", "completion": " So?"}
{"prompt": "--not \"spring\" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced.\nTony:", "completion": " I need it. Buy it. Store it."}
{"prompt": "Okay. The MIT commencement speech...\nTony:", "completion": " Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down..."}
{"prompt": "Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.\nTony:", "completion": " Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me."}
{"prompt": "I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.\nTony:", "completion": " What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?"}
{"prompt": "As a matter of fact, I do.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't like it when you have plans."}
{"prompt": "I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.\nTony:", "completion": " It's your birthday?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nTony:", "completion": " I knew that. Already?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, get yourself something nice from me."}
{"prompt": "I already did.\nTony:", "completion": " And?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, it was very nice.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay."}
{"prompt": "You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " You're good. I thought I lost you back there."}
{"prompt": "You did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland.\nTony:", "completion": " I got you. I got you."}
{"prompt": "What's wrong with you?\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Three hours.\nTony:", "completion": " I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair."}
{"prompt": "For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\nTony:", "completion": " Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!"}
{"prompt": "Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!\nTony:", "completion": " What you reading, platypus?"}
{"prompt": "Nothing.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on, sour patch."}
{"prompt": "I'm not sour.\nTony:", "completion": " Don't be mad."}
{"prompt": "I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?\nTony:", "completion": " I said I was sorry."}
{"prompt": "You don't need to apologize to me.\nTony:", "completion": " I told you I was sorry."}
{"prompt": "I'm your man.\nTony:", "completion": " Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he..."}
{"prompt": "You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.\nTony:", "completion": " I respect you."}
{"prompt": "I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now.\nTony:", "completion": " You can't have sashimi without sake."}
{"prompt": "You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.\nTony:", "completion": " It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap."}
{"prompt": "Hot sake?\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, two, please."}
{"prompt": "That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out..."}
{"prompt": "No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.\nTony:", "completion": " Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?"}
{"prompt": "No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!\nTony:", "completion": " General."}
{"prompt": "Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.\nTony:", "completion": " Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.\nTony:", "completion": " Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. For your consideration, the Jericho."}

{"prompt": "Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " Obie, what are you doing up?"}
{"prompt": "I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?\nTony:", "completion": " It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas."}
{"prompt": "Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?\nTony:", "completion": " Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\" The \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there."}
{"prompt": "Nice job.\nTony:", "completion": " See you back at base."}
{"prompt": "I wouldn't do that if I were you.\nTony:", "completion": " What the hell did you do to me?"}
{"prompt": "What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see? I have a souvenir. Take a look. I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\nTony:", "completion": " What is this?"}
{"prompt": "That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm? That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't remember."}
{"prompt": "No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\nTony:", "completion": " Where are we?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up.\nTony:", "completion": " Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?"}
{"prompt": "Do you understand me? Do as I do. He says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer \"in the history of America.\" He is honored. He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that you demonstrated. This one.\nTony:", "completion": " I refuse."}
{"prompt": "He wants to know what you think.\nTony:", "completion": " I think you got a lot of my weapons."}
{"prompt": "He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.\nTony:", "completion": " No, he won't."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\nTony:", "completion": " Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week."}
{"prompt": "Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?\nTony:", "completion": " If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools. How many languages do you speak?"}
{"prompt": "A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\nTony:", "completion": " Who are these people?"}
{"prompt": "They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings. You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh-huh. Okay, we don't need this."}
{"prompt": "What is that?\nTony:", "completion": " That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?"}
{"prompt": "Working.\nTony:", "completion": " Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this."}
{"prompt": "Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?\nTony:", "completion": " What do I call you?"}
{"prompt": "My name is Yinsen.\nTony:", "completion": " Yinsen. Nice to meet you."}
{"prompt": "Nice to meet you, too. Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.\nTony:", "completion": " That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart."}
{"prompt": "But what could it generate?\nTony:", "completion": " If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second."}
{"prompt": "That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\nTony:", "completion": " This is our ticket out of here."}
{"prompt": "What is it?\nTony:", "completion": " Flatten them out and look."}
{"prompt": "Good. Good roll. Good roll.\nTony:", "completion": " You still haven't told me where you're from."}
{"prompt": "I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place.\nTony:", "completion": " Got a family?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "Open your mouth.\nTony:", "completion": " What does he want?"}
{"prompt": "He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho.\nTony:", "completion": " What do you want? A delivery date? I need him. Good assistant."}
{"prompt": "Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again.\nTony:", "completion": " 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right."}
{"prompt": "Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\nTony:", "completion": " Say something. Say something back to him."}
{"prompt": "He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...\nTony:", "completion": " Then speak Hungarian."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I know.\nTony:", "completion": " What do you know?"}
{"prompt": "What do you know?\nTony:", "completion": " How'd that work?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.\nTony:", "completion": " That's what I do."}
{"prompt": "Let me finish this.\nTony:", "completion": " Initialize the power sequence."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Now!"}
{"prompt": "Tell me. Tell me.\nTony:", "completion": " Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now."}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nTony:", "completion": " Talk to me. Tell me when you see it."}
{"prompt": "I have it.\nTony:", "completion": " Press Control \"l\"."}
{"prompt": "\"I.\"\nTony:", "completion": " \"I.\" \"Enter.\""}
{"prompt": "Got it.\nTony:", "completion": " \"l\" and \"Enter.\" Come over here and button me up."}
{"prompt": "Okay. All right.\nTony:", "completion": " Every other hex bolt."}
{"prompt": "They're coming!\nTony:", "completion": " Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done."}
{"prompt": "They're coming.\nTony:", "completion": " Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?"}
{"prompt": "We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time.\nTony:", "completion": " Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! Yinsen! Yinsen!"}
{"prompt": "Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan! Yinsen! Yinsen!\nTony:", "completion": " Yinsen!"}
{"prompt": "Watch out! Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on. We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it."}
{"prompt": "This was always the plan, Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up."}
{"prompt": "My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this.\nTony:", "completion": " Thank you for saving me."}
{"prompt": "Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.\nTony:", "completion": " My turn. Not bad."}
{"prompt": "My turn. Not bad.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey! Hey!"}
{"prompt": "Watch it, coming up here.\nTony:", "completion": " Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them. Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?"}
{"prompt": "Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, vacation's over."}
{"prompt": "Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.\nTony:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.\nTony:", "completion": " No is a complete answer."}
{"prompt": "The doctor has to look at you.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other..."}
{"prompt": "That's enough of that.\nTony:", "completion": " ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now."}
{"prompt": "Call for a press conference?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "What on earth for?\nTony:", "completion": " Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first."}
{"prompt": "Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.\nTony:", "completion": " No, I'm fine."}
{"prompt": "Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, come on."}
{"prompt": "You get me one of those?\nTony:", "completion": " There's only one left. I need it."}
{"prompt": "Well, let's get this started, uh...\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down? Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and..."}
{"prompt": "Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to.\nTony:", "completion": " Good to see you."}
{"prompt": "Good to see you.\nTony:", "completion": " I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Stark!\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, Ben."}
{"prompt": "What happened over there?\nTony:", "completion": " I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be."}
{"prompt": "I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.\nTony:", "completion": " What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well."}
{"prompt": "Well, that..uh... That went well.\nTony:", "completion": " Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?"}
{"prompt": "Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh, optimistically, 40 points."}
{"prompt": "At minimum.\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.\nTony:", "completion": " Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy."}
{"prompt": "That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.\nTony:", "completion": " It's my name on the side of the building."}
{"prompt": "And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.\nTony:", "completion": " Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else."}
{"prompt": "Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?\nTony:", "completion": " I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology."}
{"prompt": "Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.\nTony:", "completion": " It works."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?\nTony:", "completion": " Maybe."}
{"prompt": "Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.\nTony:", "completion": " That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?"}
{"prompt": "Never mind who told me. Show me.\nTony:", "completion": " It's Rhodey or Pepper."}
{"prompt": "I want to see it.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, Rhodey."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay? It works."}
{"prompt": "Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had..."}
{"prompt": "Tony. Tony, no more of this \"ready, fire, aim\" business. You understand me?\nTony:", "completion": " That was Dad's line."}
{"prompt": "Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper. How big are your hands?"}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " How big are your hands?"}
{"prompt": "I don't understand why...\nTony:", "completion": " Get down here. I need you. Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them. Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?\nTony:", "completion": " It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump."}
{"prompt": "Speed bump, what does that mean?\nTony:", "completion": " It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine."}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do?\nTony:", "completion": " Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God!\nTony:", "completion": " I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out."}
{"prompt": "Is it safe?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes \"beep.\""}
{"prompt": "What do you mean, \"Operation\"?\nTony:", "completion": " It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay? Great."}
{"prompt": "You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.\nTony:", "completion": " No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm..."}
{"prompt": "Okay, okay.\nTony:", "completion": " I really need your help here."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Oh, there's pus!\nTony:", "completion": " It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body."}
{"prompt": "It smells!\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?"}
{"prompt": "Okay, I got it! I got it!\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nTony:", "completion": " That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't... There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God!\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, I was not expecting..."}
{"prompt": "Okay, what do I do?\nTony:", "completion": " Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!"}
{"prompt": "What's wrong?\nTony:", "completion": " Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--"}
{"prompt": "What? You said it was safe!\nTony:", "completion": " 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick."}
{"prompt": "Okay. Okay. Tony?\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "It's going to be okay. Okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Is it?"}
{"prompt": "It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you... Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, I feel great. You okay?"}
{"prompt": "Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't have anyone but you. Anyway..."}
{"prompt": "What do you want me to do with this?\nTony:", "completion": " That? Destroy it. Incinerate it."}
{"prompt": "You don't want to keep it?\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper, I've been called many things. \"Nostalgic\" is not one of them."}
{"prompt": "Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " That will be all, Miss Potts. Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff."}
{"prompt": "The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.\nTony:", "completion": " Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?"}
{"prompt": "Hello, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with."}
{"prompt": "Don't do that!\nTony:", "completion": " What was his name?"}
{"prompt": "Don't do that.\nTony:", "completion": " Was it Ivan?"}
{"prompt": "Don't do that. They'll believe it.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Don't do that.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Don't do that.\nTony:", "completion": " Pleasure meeting you."}
{"prompt": "Give us a couple minutes, you guys. I'm surprised.\nTony:", "completion": " Why?"}
{"prompt": "I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm doing a little better than walking."}
{"prompt": "Really?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it."}
{"prompt": "You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.\nTony:", "completion": " This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different."}
{"prompt": "What? You're a humanitarian now or something?\nTony:", "completion": " I need you to listen to me."}
{"prompt": "No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "It's nice seeing you, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " Thanks."}
{"prompt": "Thanks.\nTony:", "completion": " JARVIS, you up?"}
{"prompt": "For you, sir, always.\nTony:", "completion": " I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two."}
{"prompt": "Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?\nTony:", "completion": " Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?"}
{"prompt": "Working on a secret project, are we, sir?\nTony:", "completion": " I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."}
{"prompt": "I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.\nTony:", "completion": " Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy."}
{"prompt": "Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one."}

{"prompt": "Obadiah's upstairs.\nTony:", "completion": " Great!"}
{"prompt": "What would you like me to tell him?\nTony:", "completion": " Great. I'll be right up."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.\nTony:", "completion": " It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless. I didn't expect that. How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.\nTony:", "completion": " Sure doesn't. Oh, boy."}
{"prompt": "It would have gone better if you were there.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all..."}
{"prompt": "Hey, come on. In public. The press. This was a board of directors meeting.\nTony:", "completion": " This was a board of directors meeting?"}
{"prompt": "The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction.\nTony:", "completion": " A what?"}
{"prompt": "They want to lock you out.\nTony:", "completion": " Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen."}
{"prompt": "Fifty-six and a half.\nTony:", "completion": " It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company."}
{"prompt": "Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great."}
{"prompt": "Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " I'll be in the shop."}
{"prompt": "Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.\nTony:", "completion": " No. No, absolutely not."}
{"prompt": "It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!\nTony:", "completion": " This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it."}
{"prompt": "All right, well, this stays with me, then. Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.\nTony:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?\nTony:", "completion": " Good night, Obie."}
{"prompt": "Good night, Obie.\nTony:", "completion": " Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety.

Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

{"prompt": "Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.\nTony:", "completion": " Do a check on control surfaces"}
{"prompt": "As you wish. Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control."}

{"prompt": "The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Records are made to be broken! Come on!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.\nTony:", "completion": " Keep going! Higher! We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!"}
{"prompt": "Keep going! Higher! We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!\nTony:", "completion": " Kill power."}
{"prompt": "Kill power.\nTony:", "completion": " Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor."}
{"prompt": "A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.\nTony:", "completion": " Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?"}
{"prompt": "Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?\nTony:", "completion": " Thrill me."}
{"prompt": "Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society.\nTony:", "completion": " JARVIS, we get an invite for that?"}
{"prompt": "The render is complete.\nTony:", "completion": " A little ostentatious, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.\nTony:", "completion": " Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there."}
{"prompt": "Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it."}
{"prompt": "Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.\nTony:", "completion": " Don't wait up for me, honey."}

{"prompt": "How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?\nTony:", "completion": " Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you."}

{"prompt": "Oh, no.\nTony:", "completion": " All right, come on."}
{"prompt": "Thank you. No.\nTony:", "completion": " Am I making you uncomfortable?"}
{"prompt": "No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.\nTony:", "completion": " You look great and you smell great."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God.\nTony:", "completion": " But I could fire you if that would take the edge off."}
{"prompt": "I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.\nTony:", "completion": " I'd make it a week. Sure."}
{"prompt": "Really? What's your Social Security number?\nTony:", "completion": " Five."}
{"prompt": "Five?\nTony:", "completion": " Right."}
{"prompt": "Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.\nTony:", "completion": " The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.\nTony:", "completion": " Totally harmless."}
{"prompt": "It was totally not harmless, by the way.\nTony:", "completion": " We're dancing. No one's even watching."}
{"prompt": "Everybody who I work with... No, you know why?\nTony:", "completion": " I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced."}
{"prompt": "No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you.\nTony:", "completion": " I don't think it was taken that way."}
{"prompt": "Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...\nTony:", "completion": " I just think you're overstating it."}
{"prompt": "You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please.\nTony:", "completion": " Got it, okay."}
{"prompt": "I would like a vodka martini, please.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.\nTony:", "completion": " Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?"}
{"prompt": "Wow. Tony Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, hey."}

{"prompt": "Christine.\nTony:", "completion": " Carrie."}
{"prompt": "Christine.\nTony:", "completion": " That's right."}
{"prompt": "You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?\nTony:", "completion": " Panic. I would say panic is my reaction."}
{"prompt": "'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you."}
{"prompt": "I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.\nTony:", "completion": " I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear."}
{"prompt": "Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\nTony:", "completion": " When were these taken?"}
{"prompt": "Yesterday.\nTony:", "completion": " I didn't approve any shipment."}
{"prompt": "Well, your company did.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, I'm not my company."}
{"prompt": "Please, do you mind?\nTony:", "completion": " Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?"}
{"prompt": "Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive.\nTony:", "completion": " You know what? I was naive before, when they said, \"Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business.\" If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?"}
{"prompt": "The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, \"Where are my mother and father?\" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.\nTony:", "completion": " He's all yours."}

{"prompt": "What in the hell is that noise?\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, well, I need your help right now.\nTony:", "completion": " It's funny how that works, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?"}
{"prompt": "Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?\nTony:", "completion": " I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon."}
{"prompt": "I thought you were driving.\nTony:", "completion": " Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog."}
{"prompt": "You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?\nTony:", "completion": " Nope!"}
{"prompt": "Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.\nTony:", "completion": " That's my exit."}
{"prompt": "Then you are clear to engage.\nTony:", "completion": " Hit it."}
{"prompt": "Inbound missile.\nTony:", "completion": " Flares!"}

{"prompt": "Hello?\nTony:", "completion": " Hi, Rhodey, it's me."}
{"prompt": "It's who?\nTony:", "completion": " I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me."}
{"prompt": "No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?\nTony:", "completion": " This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!"}
{"prompt": "Tony, you still there?\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, thanks."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?\nTony:", "completion": " Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?"}
{"prompt": "It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey!"}
{"prompt": "It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.\nTony:", "completion": " Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to..."}

You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading."}
{"prompt": "And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?\nTony:", "completion": " Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them."}
{"prompt": "Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.\nTony:", "completion": " There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else."}
{"prompt": "Is that so? Well, then, I quit.\nTony:", "completion": " You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?"}
{"prompt": "You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.\nTony:", "completion": " I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."}
{"prompt": "I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.\nTony:", "completion": " Good boy."}
{"prompt": "Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Where's Pepper?"}
{"prompt": "She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah.\nTony:", "completion": " That's not going to be enough."}
{"prompt": "That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.\nTony:", "completion": " Not bad, huh? Let's do it."}
{"prompt": "You need me to do anything else?\nTony:", "completion": " Keep the skies clear."}
{"prompt": "I thought it'd be bigger.\nTony:", "completion": " How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?"}
{"prompt": "The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.\nTony:", "completion": " Keep me posted. Pepper!"}
{"prompt": "Tony! Tony, are you okay?\nTony:", "completion": " I'm fine. How are..."}
{"prompt": "Obadiah, he's gone insane!\nTony:", "completion": " I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there."}
{"prompt": "He built a suit.\nTony:", "completion": " Get out of there right now!"}
{"prompt": "Where do you think you're going? Your services are no longer required.\nTony:", "completion": " Stane!"}
{"prompt": "I love this suit!\nTony:", "completion": " Put them down!"}
{"prompt": "Collateral damage, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " Divert power to chest RT."}
{"prompt": "Power reduced to 19%.\nTony:", "completion": " Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.\nTony:", "completion": " Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude."}
{"prompt": "With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--\nTony:", "completion": " I know the math! Do it!"}
{"prompt": "Thirteen percent power, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Climb!"}
{"prompt": "Eleven percent.\nTony:", "completion": " Keep going!"}
{"prompt": "Seven percent power.\nTony:", "completion": " Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!"}
{"prompt": "You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!\nTony:", "completion": " How'd you solve the icing problem?"}
{"prompt": "Icing problem?\nTony:", "completion": " Might want to look into it."}
{"prompt": "Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.\nTony:", "completion": " Woah! Potts!"}
{"prompt": "Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\nTony:", "completion": " I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there."}
{"prompt": "Nice try!\nTony:", "completion": " Weapons status?"}
{"prompt": "Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\nTony:", "completion": " Flares!"}
{"prompt": "Very clever, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " Potts?"}
{"prompt": "Tony!\nTony:", "completion": " This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof."}
{"prompt": "Well, how are you going to do that?\nTony:", "completion": " You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here."}
{"prompt": "Okay. I'm going in now.\nTony:", "completion": " Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important!"}
{"prompt": "How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper!"}
{"prompt": "And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!\nTony:", "completion": " Time to hit the button!"}
{"prompt": "Hold still, you little prick!\nTony:", "completion": " Just do it!"}
{"prompt": "You'll die!\nTony:", "completion": " Push it!"}
{"prompt": "You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...\nTony:", "completion": " \"Iron Man.\" That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway."}
{"prompt": "Here's your alibi.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay?"}
{"prompt": "You were on your yacht.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.\nTony:", "completion": " See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island."}
{"prompt": "That's what happened.\nTony:", "completion": " All right."}
{"prompt": "Just read it, word for word.\nTony:", "completion": " There's nothing about Stane here."}
{"prompt": "That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.\nTony:", "completion": " But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?"}
{"prompt": "Right. Let's get this show on the road.\nTony:", "completion": " You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man."}
{"prompt": "You're not Iron Man.\nTony:", "completion": " Am so."}
{"prompt": "You're not.\nTony:", "completion": " All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night."}
{"prompt": "What night?\nTony:", "completion": " You know."}
{"prompt": "Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts."}
{"prompt": "And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.\nTony:", "completion": " Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop..."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...\nTony:", "completion": " I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero."}
{"prompt": "I never said you were a superhero.\nTony:", "completion": " Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public."}
{"prompt": "Just stick to the cards, man.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.\nTony:", "completion": " Jarvis!"}
{"prompt": "Welcome home, Sir.\nFury:", "completion": " \"I am Iron Man.\" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet."}
{"prompt": "\"I am Iron Man.\" You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.\nTony:", "completion": " Who the hell are you?"}
{"prompt": "Who the hell are you?\nFury:", "completion": " Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D."}
{"prompt": "Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nTony:", "completion": " Ah."}
{"prompt": "Tony, Tony\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, hey."}
{"prompt": "Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.\nTony:", "completion": " Hello. It would be a pleasure."}
{"prompt": "Okay\nTony:", "completion": " See you buddy"}
{"prompt": "This is Larry.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you."}
{"prompt": "Larry King.\nTony:", "completion": " Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people."}
{"prompt": "Come on, Tony. There we go.\nTony:", "completion": " Very mellow."}
{"prompt": "Look what we got here, the new model.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, does she come with the car?"}
{"prompt": "I certainly hope so. Hi.\nTony:", "completion": " Hi. And you are?"}
{"prompt": "Marshal.\nTony:", "completion": " Irish. I like it."}
{"prompt": "Bedford.\nTony:", "completion": " What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Looking for you.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?"}
{"prompt": "Serving subpoenas.\nTony:", "completion": " Yikes."}
{"prompt": "I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.\nTony:", "completion": " Can I see a badge?"}
{"prompt": "You still like it?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep. How far are we from D.C.?"}
{"prompt": "Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes dear?"}
{"prompt": "Can I have your attention?\nTony:", "completion": " Absolutely."}
{"prompt": "Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?\nTony:", "completion": " I do not."}
{"prompt": "You do not?\nTony:", "completion": " I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon."}
{"prompt": "The Iron Man weapon.\nTony:", "completion": " My device does not fit that description."}
{"prompt": "That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.\nTony:", "completion": " Rhodey? What?"}
{"prompt": "Can you turn that off? Take it off.\nTony:", "completion": " Iran."}
{"prompt": "Iran.\nTony:", "completion": " No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?"}
{"prompt": "Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " You!"}
{"prompt": "We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Check palladium levels."}
{"prompt": "Is this a joke? What are you thinking?\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?\nTony:", "completion": " No. Our stocks have never been higher."}
{"prompt": "I do what?\nTony:", "completion": " Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company."}
{"prompt": "Rushman. Natalie Rushman\nTony:", "completion": " Front and centre. Come into the church."}
{"prompt": "No problem.\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper."}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " Who is she?"}
{"prompt": "She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.\nTony:", "completion": " I need a new assistant, boss."}
{"prompt": "What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?\nTony:", "completion": " How do I spell your name, Natalie?"}
{"prompt": "What, are you gonna google her now?\nTony:", "completion": " I thought I was ogling her. Wow. Very, very impressive individual."}
{"prompt": "No one speaks Latin.\nTony:", "completion": " No one speaks Latin"}
{"prompt": "I just slipped.\nTony:", "completion": " You did?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Looks like a TKO to me."}
{"prompt": "I meant your fingerprint.\nTony:", "completion": " Right."}
{"prompt": "Will that be all, Mr Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much.\nTony:", "completion": " I want one."}
{"prompt": "Mr Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " Hey."}
{"prompt": "When did this happen?\nTony:", "completion": " What? You made me do it."}
{"prompt": "Right this way.\nTony:", "completion": " You look fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Absolutely.\nTony:", "completion": " Is this us?"}
{"prompt": "It can be.\nTony:", "completion": " Great. Make it us."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much.\nTony:", "completion": " Green is not your best colour."}
{"prompt": "Anthony. Is that you?\nTony:", "completion": " My least favourite person on Earth."}
{"prompt": "Hey, pal.\nTony:", "completion": " Justin Hammer."}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, roughly."}
{"prompt": "Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.\nTony:", "completion": " And she wrote a story as well."}
{"prompt": "It was very impressive.\nTony:", "completion": " That was good."}
{"prompt": "Looking gorgeous.\nTony:", "completion": " Please, this is tough."}
{"prompt": "Mr Stark?\nTony:", "completion": " Yes?"}
{"prompt": "I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.\nTony:", "completion": " Hammer needs a slot, Christine."}
{"prompt": "Car!\nTony:", "completion": " Are you okay?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Were you heading from me or him?"}
{"prompt": "Are you out of your mind?\nTony:", "completion": " Better security."}
{"prompt": "Get in the car right now!\nTony:", "completion": " I was attacked. We need better security."}
{"prompt": "I got him!\nTony:", "completion": " Hit him again. Hit him again. Football."}
{"prompt": "Take the case! Take it!\nTony:", "completion": " Give him the case!"}
{"prompt": "Stop banging the car!\nTony:", "completion": " Calm down."}
{"prompt": "God. God.\nTony:", "completion": " Give me the case! Please! Come on!"}
{"prompt": "You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.\nTony:", "completion": " Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?"}
{"prompt": "My father. Anton Vanko.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, I never heard of him."}
{"prompt": "What is that?\nTony:", "completion": " This is your in-flight meal."}
{"prompt": "Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.\nTony:", "completion": " As CEO, you are entitled to a leave."}
{"prompt": "A leave?\nTony:", "completion": " A company retreat."}
{"prompt": "Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, I should get to my desk. See that cigar box?"}
{"prompt": "You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?\nTony:", "completion": " Road rash. Thank you. What are you looking at?"}
{"prompt": "Ill-timed.\nTony:", "completion": " Right, sends the wrong message."}
{"prompt": "Legal.\nTony:", "completion": " Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?"}
{"prompt": "Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?\nTony:", "completion": " I love you."}
{"prompt": "You just peed in the suit.\nTony:", "completion": " I know. It has a filtration system."}
{"prompt": "Pepper! Get out of here. Get out of here now.\nTony:", "completion": " You want it? Take it!"}
{"prompt": "Put you hand down.\nTony:", "completion": " You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?"}
{"prompt": "Put it down!\nTony:", "completion": " You gonna take a shot?"}
{"prompt": "Put it down!\nTony:", "completion": " No!"}
{"prompt": "Drop it Tony!\nTony:", "completion": " Take it!"}
{"prompt": "Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.\nTony:", "completion": " Hi."}
{"prompt": "What do you want from me?\nFury:", "completion": " What do we want from you? What do you want from me? You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. Hit him."}
{"prompt": "What do we want from you? What do you want from me? You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. Hit him.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you sir.\nFury:", "completion": " That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology."}
{"prompt": "No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.\nTony:", "completion": " Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?"}
{"prompt": "He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.\nTony:", "completion": " He said that?"}
{"prompt": "Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.\nFury:", "completion": " As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD."}
{"prompt": "As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nFury:", "completion": " And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you."}
{"prompt": "Are you Iron Man?\nTony:", "completion": " Sometimes."}
{"prompt": "Miss Potts?\nTony:", "completion": " Relax."}
{"prompt": "No, he will not. Bye.\nTony:", "completion": " I would like to be. Got a minute?"}
{"prompt": "Hi, come on in.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Wheels up in 25 minutes."}
{"prompt": "\nTony:", "completion": " Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?"}
{"prompt": "Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected."}
{"prompt": "1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " How many buildings are there?"}
{"prompt": "Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?\nTony:", "completion": " That was rhetorical. Just show me. What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them."}
{"prompt": "The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.\nTony:", "completion": " Thank Dad."}
{"prompt": "I heard you broke the perimeter.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?"}
{"prompt": "Something like that. Good luck.\nTony:", "completion": " Bye. Thanks."}
{"prompt": "We need you.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, more than you know."}
{"prompt": "Initialising prismatic accelerator. Approaching maximum power.\nTony:", "completion": " That was easy."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.\nTony:", "completion": " You what?"}
{"prompt": "You too.\nTony:", "completion": " Trace him."}
{"prompt": "Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.\nTony:", "completion": " Jarvis, where is he?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, all right. Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " What is he?"}
{"prompt": "Who?\nTony:", "completion": " Tell me."}
{"prompt": "Whoa, whoa, whoa.\nTony:", "completion": " Is that you?"}
{"prompt": "No, no!\nTony:", "completion": " Jarvis, break in. I need to own him."}
{"prompt": "Ivan. Ivan Vanko.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "Okay. Right away. Right away. Step aside. Step aside. Tell me everything you know. Go.\nTony:", "completion": " How are we doing Jarvis?"}
{"prompt": "In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Stay in the car."}
{"prompt": "I got him!\nTony:", "completion": " Rhodey, you still locked on?"}
{"prompt": "Tony.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Reboot complete You got your best friend back."}
{"prompt": "Reboot complete You got your best friend back.\nTony:", "completion": " Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff."}
{"prompt": "Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising."}
{"prompt": "Fine.\nTony:", "completion": " We could have been in Venice."}
{"prompt": "Oh, man. You can have your suit back.\nTony:", "completion": " You okay?"}
{"prompt": "I meant me.\nTony:", "completion": " You have a big gun. You are not the big gun."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah. Nice.\nTony:", "completion": " Rhodey? Get down."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nBlack Widow:", "completion": " Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. The repulsor signature is significantly higher."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " I got this. Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?"}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up."}
{"prompt": "This is your idea?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper?"}
{"prompt": "Thank you.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Run that by me again."}
{"prompt": "I was here first. Get a roof.\nTony:", "completion": " I thought you were out of one-liners."}
{"prompt": "Half hour till the ball drops.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, do you want...?"}
{"prompt": "I got you, pal.\nTony:", "completion": " I gave a speech? How was it?"}
{"prompt": "Unintelligible.\nTony:", "completion": " Really?"}
{"prompt": "Mmm-hmm.\nTony:", "completion": " It's my favorite kind, a winning combo."}
{"prompt": "Where are we going?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research."}
{"prompt": "Ho Yinsen.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, I finally met a man called \"Ho.\""}
{"prompt": "I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, this guy."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey. You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I..."}
{"prompt": "My work?\nTony:", "completion": " Who isn't? He means me."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, we're full.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut."}
{"prompt": "Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately-funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh... she'll take both."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " One to throw away and one to not call."}
{"prompt": "Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. Do you get it?\nTony:", "completion": " I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt."}
{"prompt": "Aw!\nTony:", "completion": " Ladies, follow the mullet.Ladies first."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, I'll call you.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm titillated by the notion of working with you."}
{"prompt": "Yeah?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?"}
{"prompt": "I'll see you up there.\nTony:", "completion": " Damn betcha."}
{"prompt": "Damn betcha.\nTony:", "completion": " Wow."}
{"prompt": "...And chemically recode it.\nTony:", "completion": " That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic..."}
{"prompt": "...Genetic operating system...\nTony:", "completion": " ...of a..."}
{"prompt": "Exactly.\nTony:", "completion": " ...living organism."}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nTony:", "completion": " Wow."}
{"prompt": "That's cute, but...\nTony:", "completion": " Leave her ficus alone."}
{"prompt": "Because... and, no, seriously don't.\nTony:", "completion": " And you're starting with plants?"}
{"prompt": "For now, yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Huh."}
{"prompt": "Dendritic revitalization.\nTony:", "completion": " It's revolutionary."}
{"prompt": "Disease prevention...\nTony:", "completion": " Changes the world."}
{"prompt": "...even limb regrowth.\nTony:", "completion": " You're the most gifted woman I've ever met."}
{"prompt": "Wow.\nTony:", "completion": " In Switzerland."}
{"prompt": "Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.\nTony:", "completion": " This week."}
{"prompt": "This week.\nTony:", "completion": " You almost bought it, didn't you?"}
{"prompt": "This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.\nTony:", "completion": " Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?"}
{"prompt": "Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.\nTony:", "completion": " We're good."}
{"prompt": "Stay down.\nTony:", "completion": " You're...you're right on me. I made it. What the hell was that?"}
{"prompt": "It's a glitch in my work. It's...\nTony:", "completion": " She was just talking about it. Glitches happening."}
{"prompt": "No.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey!"}
{"prompt": "Happy New Year.\nTony:", "completion": " Happy New Year."}
{"prompt": "Happy New Year.\nTony:", "completion": " Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight."}
{"prompt": "You good?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "I'll be right outside.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it."}
{"prompt": "So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.\nTony:", "completion": " Ow!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...\nTony:", "completion": " No. Forty-eight. Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete."}
{"prompt": "As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.\nTony:", "completion": " Which I will. Right, let's do this."}

{"prompt": "Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it."}
{"prompt": "Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.\nTony:", "completion": " Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother."}

{"prompt": "Cool it, will you, Jarvis?\nTony:", "completion": " Come on. I ain't scared of you."}
{"prompt": "Come on. I ain't scared of you.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm the best."}
{"prompt": "As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.\nTony:", "completion": " And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV."}
{"prompt": "And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.\nTony:", "completion": " That's when he happened."}
{"prompt": "It tested well with focus groups, alright?\nTony:", "completion": " I am Iron Patriot..."}
{"prompt": "Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.\nTony:", "completion": " So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?"}
{"prompt": "It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.\nTony:", "completion": " Nine."}
{"prompt": "The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.\nTony:", "completion": " You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air."}
{"prompt": "When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?\nTony:", "completion": " Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?"}
{"prompt": "People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.\nTony:", "completion": " You're gonna come at me like that?"}
{"prompt": "Do you mind signing my drawing?\nTony:", "completion": " If Richard doesn't mind. You alright with this, Dick?"}
{"prompt": "Fine with me.\nTony:", "completion": " What's your name?"}
{"prompt": "Erin.\nTony:", "completion": " I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way."}
{"prompt": "Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...\nTony:", "completion": " It's not superhero business, I get it."}
{"prompt": "No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.\nTony:", "completion": " That's why I said I...got it."}
{"prompt": "Are you okay?\nTony:", "completion": " I broke the crayon."}
{"prompt": "Wait a minute! Tony!\nTony:", "completion": " What'd he say?!"}
{"prompt": "Tony!\nTony:", "completion": " Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay."}

{"prompt": "No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, so I was poisoned?"}
{"prompt": "My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.\nTony:", "completion": " Me?"}
{"prompt": "Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.\nTony:", "completion": " Sorry, I gotta split."}
{"prompt": "Hello?\nTony:", "completion": " Is this forehead of Security?"}
{"prompt": "What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.\nTony:", "completion": " What? Harassing interns?"}
{"prompt": "I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.\nTony:", "completion": " What's going on? Fill me in."}
{"prompt": "For real?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.\nTony:", "completion": " Right."}
{"prompt": "I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?\nTony:", "completion": " Um...Switzerland."}
{"prompt": "Right, right, exactly.\nTony:", "completion": " Killian? No, I don't remember that guy."}
{"prompt": "Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.\nTony:", "completion": " His what?"}
{"prompt": "Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?\nTony:", "completion": " Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started."}
{"prompt": "I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.\nTony:", "completion": " Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing."}
{"prompt": "Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.\nTony:", "completion": " Relax."}
{"prompt": "Seriously?\nTony:", "completion": " I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?"}
{"prompt": "You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.\nTony:", "completion": " A giant brain?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.\nTony:", "completion": " I miss you, Happy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...\nTony:", "completion": " Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?"}
{"prompt": "Why?\nTony:", "completion": " I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her."}
{"prompt": "You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby."}
{"prompt": "Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?\nTony:", "completion": " Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so."}
{"prompt": "Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?"}
{"prompt": "Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?\nTony:", "completion": " Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " So, uh...tense? Good day?"}
{"prompt": "So, uh...tense? Good day?\nTony:", "completion": " Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?"}
{"prompt": "Did I like it?\nTony:", "completion": " Nailed it, right?"}
{"prompt": "So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?\nTony:", "completion": " Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the..."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.\nTony:", "completion": " The facial slit?"}
{"prompt": "Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?\nTony:", "completion": " Crowbar. Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Crowbar. Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak."}
{"prompt": "I'll take my chances.\nTony:", "completion": " That's risky."}
{"prompt": "That's risky.\nTony:", "completion": " At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that."}
{"prompt": "At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.\nTony:", "completion": " Busted."}
{"prompt": "This is a new level of lame.\nTony:", "completion": " Sorry."}
{"prompt": "You ate without me, already? On date night?\nTony:", "completion": " He was just..."}
{"prompt": "You mean you?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work."}
{"prompt": "Uh-huh.\nTony:", "completion": " And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian."}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?\nTony:", "completion": " Happy was concerned."}

{"prompt": "I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.\nTony:", "completion": " Nothing's been the same since New York."}
{"prompt": "Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.\nTony:", "completion": " You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker."}

{"prompt": "And you're gonna join me.\nTony:", "completion": " Better."}
{"prompt": "Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...\nTony:", "completion": " Power down!"}
{"prompt": "Power down!\nTony:", "completion": " I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?"}
{"prompt": "I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Don't go, alright? Pepper?"}
{"prompt": "True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.\nTony:", "completion": " Hi."}
{"prompt": "Oh.\nTony:", "completion": " Uh...mind leaving that on?"}
{"prompt": "Sure.\nTony:", "completion": " Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them."}
{"prompt": "Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'.\nTony:", "completion": " Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what you wanted, right? Bill me."}
{"prompt": "I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning \"adviser to the King\". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. Close."}
{"prompt": "The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.\nTony:", "completion": " No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater."}
{"prompt": "No, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Talk to me, Happy. When is a bomb not a bomb? When is a bomb not a bomb? Any military victims?"}
{"prompt": "Not according to public records, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees."}
{"prompt": "The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.\nTony:", "completion": " Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. Nope. That. You sure that's not one of his?"}
{"prompt": "It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.\nTony:", "completion": " Bring her around."}
{"prompt": "The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius.\nTony:", "completion": " That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?"}
{"prompt": "Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.\nTony:", "completion": " Are we still at \"ding-dong\"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?"}
{"prompt": "There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address.\nTony:", "completion": " Right there's fine. You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?"}
{"prompt": "You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?\nTony:", "completion": " Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast."}
{"prompt": "Gluten-free waffles, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " That's right."}
{"prompt": "Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.\nTony:", "completion": " Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. It's...with her."}
{"prompt": "Tony, is somebody there?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met."}
{"prompt": "He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.\nTony:", "completion": " What...what for? Why now?"}
{"prompt": "Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.\nTony:", "completion": " I'll be fine."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.\nTony:", "completion": " We weren't."}
{"prompt": "And old girlfriends!\nTony:", "completion": " She's not really."}
{"prompt": "No, not really. It...it was just one night.\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.\nTony:", "completion": " It was a great night."}
{"prompt": "I'm sure.\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Trust me. We're going out of town.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, we've been through this. Nope."}
{"prompt": "Yep!\nTony:", "completion": " The man says no."}
{"prompt": "Immediately and indefinitely!\nTony:", "completion": " Honey..."}
{"prompt": "Great idea. Let's go.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags."}

{"prompt": "Guys, can we um...\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "I got you.\nTony:", "completion": " I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. Move! I'm right behind! Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go!"}
{"prompt": "Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure.\nTony:", "completion": " Jarvis, where's my flight power?!"}
{"prompt": "Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.\nTony:", "completion": " That's one."}
{"prompt": "Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.\nTony:", "completion": " That's two."}
{"prompt": "Sir. Sir!\nTony:", "completion": " Alright, kill the alarm. I got it."}
{"prompt": "That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent.\nTony:", "completion": " It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?"}
{"prompt": "We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.\nTony:", "completion": " Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta..."}
{"prompt": "I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.\nTony:", "completion": " Who asked you? Open the suit."}
{"prompt": "I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Open eject. That's brisk! Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit."}
{"prompt": "I actually think I need to sleep now, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy."}
{"prompt": "Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.\nTony:", "completion": " Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. Let's get you comfy. You happy now?"}
{"prompt": "Freeze! Don't move.\nTony:", "completion": " You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. And now you're out of ammo."}
{"prompt": "What's that thing on your chest?\nTony:", "completion": " It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here."}
{"prompt": "What does it power? Oh my God! Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?\nTony:", "completion": " Technically, I am."}
{"prompt": "Technically, you're dead.\nTony:", "completion": " A valid point."}
{"prompt": "What happened to him?\nTony:", "completion": " Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him."}
{"prompt": "Like a mechanic?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.\nTony:", "completion": " It's Iron Patriot now."}
{"prompt": "That's way cooler!\nTony:", "completion": " No, it's not."}
{"prompt": "Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...\nTony:", "completion": " Retroreflective panels?"}
{"prompt": "To make him stealth mode.\nTony:", "completion": " You want a stealth mode?"}
{"prompt": "Cool, right?\nTony:", "completion": " That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one."}
{"prompt": "Oops!\nTony:", "completion": " Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone."}
{"prompt": "S...Sorry.\nTony:", "completion": " Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?"}
{"prompt": "Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.\nTony:", "completion": " Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich."}
{"prompt": "What's in it for me?\nTony:", "completion": " Salvation. What's his name?"}
{"prompt": "Who?\nTony:", "completion": " The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?"}
{"prompt": "How'd you know that?\nTony:", "completion": " I got just the thing. This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon.

{"prompt": "Well then. What are we waiting for?\nTony:", "completion": " The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that."}
{"prompt": "She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?\nTony:", "completion": " Maybe never, relax about it."}
{"prompt": "What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?\nTony:", "completion": " I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. What's the official story here? What happened?"}
{"prompt": "I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here.\nTony:", "completion": " Six people died, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Including Chad Davis?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. That doesn't make sense. Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.\nTony:", "completion": " Do you buy that?"}
{"prompt": "That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?\nTony:", "completion": " No idea. I'm not...I don't care."}
{"prompt": "That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?\nTony:", "completion": " That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it."}
{"prompt": "Are they coming back? The aliens?\nTony:", "completion": " Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?"}
{"prompt": "Does this subject make you...make you edgy?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?"}
{"prompt": "Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?\nTony:", "completion": " Nope."}
{"prompt": "Do you need to be on it?\nTony:", "completion": " Probably."}

{"prompt": "What did I say? Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. What the hell was that?\nTony:", "completion": " Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?"}

{"prompt": "Alright. Where'd you like to start?\nTony:", "completion": " I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened."}
{"prompt": "Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.\nTony:", "completion": " Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him."}
{"prompt": "What?\nTony:", "completion": " As a weapon."}

{"prompt": "Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, \"I want my god damn file.\"\nTony:", "completion": " It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass."}
{"prompt": "You're welcome\nTony:", "completion": " For what? Did I miss something?"}
{"prompt": "Me saving your life\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose."}
{"prompt": "Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.\nTony:", "completion": " What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. I'm sorry, kid, you did good."}
{"prompt": "So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?"}
{"prompt": "I'm cold.\nTony:", "completion": " I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-"}
{"prompt": "Don't move! Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?\nTony:", "completion": " You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?\nTony:", "completion": " It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?"}
{"prompt": "A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?\nTony:", "completion": " Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login."}
{"prompt": "It's the same as it's always been, \"WarMachine68.\"\nTony:", "completion": " And password, please."}
{"prompt": "Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " It's not the '80s, nobody says \"hack\" any more. Give me your login."}
{"prompt": "\"WAR MACHINE ROX\" with an \"X,\" all caps.\nTony:", "completion": " That is so much better than \"lron Patriot.\""}
{"prompt": "Because you erase my shows!\nTony:", "completion": " That ain't gonna cut it."}
{"prompt": "We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...\nTony:", "completion": " Shh."}
{"prompt": "Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.\nTony:", "completion": " Shh. Keep it down."}
{"prompt": "Tony Stark is in my van!\nTony:", "completion": " No, he's not."}
{"prompt": "I knew you were still alive!\nTony:", "completion": " Come on in. Close the door. Shh..."}
{"prompt": "Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "I am your biggest fan.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?"}
{"prompt": "No, no, no. Just us.\nTony:", "completion": " Great. What's your name?"}
{"prompt": "Gary\nTony:", "completion": " Gary?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, wow.\nTony:", "completion": " Right there is fine."}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay."}
{"prompt": "Oh, good. Can I just say?\nTony:", "completion": " What do you want?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...\nTony:", "completion": " It's fine."}
{"prompt": "It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.\nTony:", "completion": " Right."}
{"prompt": "I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!\nTony:", "completion": " A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...\nTony:", "completion": " Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%."}
{"prompt": "Got it.\nTony:", "completion": " All right? It's a mission."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nTony:", "completion": " Tony needs Gary."}
{"prompt": "And Gary needs Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " Be quiet about it. Go."}
{"prompt": "Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here!\nTony:", "completion": " A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal."}
{"prompt": "That's the plan, Colonel.\nTony:", "completion": " Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?\nTony:", "completion": " How much have you had?"}
{"prompt": "Two or three bowls.\nTony:", "completion": " Can you still see straight?"}
{"prompt": "Sort of.\nTony:", "completion": " That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?"}
{"prompt": "It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.\nTony:", "completion": " What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?"}
{"prompt": "Actually, sir, it's in Miami.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is."}
{"prompt": "Um, it does say Miami, Florida.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?"}
{"prompt": "Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.\nTony:", "completion": " What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... Oh, God, not again."}
{"prompt": "Tony? Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.\nTony:", "completion": " Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it."}
{"prompt": "Okay, um, uh...\nTony:", "completion": " God, what am I gonna do?"}
{"prompt": "Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?\nTony:", "completion": " Right."}
{"prompt": "You said so.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, I did."}
{"prompt": "Why don't you just build something?\nTony:", "completion": " Okay. Thanks, kid."}
{"prompt": "They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.\nTony:", "completion": " Hey!"}
{"prompt": "Bloody hell. Bloody hell.\nTony:", "completion": " Don't move."}
{"prompt": "I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.\nTony:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?\nTony:", "completion": " Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?"}
{"prompt": "Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.\nTony:", "completion": " What do you mean?"}
{"prompt": "It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.\nTony:", "completion": " It is?"}
{"prompt": "It's complicated.\nTony:", "completion": " Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit."}
{"prompt": "My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.\nTony:", "completion": " What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?"}
{"prompt": "What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.\nTony:", "completion": " You got a minute to live. Fill it with words."}
{"prompt": "It's just a role. \"The Mandarin,\" see, it's not real.\nTony:", "completion": " Then how did you get here, Trevor?"}
{"prompt": "Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.\nTony:", "completion": " Next?"}
{"prompt": "Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.\nTony:", "completion": " What did they say? They'd get you off them?"}
{"prompt": "They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.\nTony:", "completion": " Did you just nod off? Hey."}
{"prompt": "No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions.\nTony:", "completion": " \"He\"? Killian?"}
{"prompt": "Killian.\nTony:", "completion": " He created you?"}
{"prompt": "He created me.\nTony:", "completion": " Custom-made terror threat."}
{"prompt": "Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.\nTony:", "completion": " Your performance? Where people died?"}
{"prompt": "No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under..."}
{"prompt": "Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.\nTony:", "completion": " Ah... Okay."}
{"prompt": "It's just like old times, huh?\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball."}
{"prompt": "It wasn't my idea.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay. So you took Killian's card."}
{"prompt": "I took his money.\nTony:", "completion": " And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon."}
{"prompt": "No.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah."}
{"prompt": "No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah?"}
{"prompt": "A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm telling you it isn't. I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself."}
{"prompt": "Then help me fix it.\nTony:", "completion": " Did I do that?"}
{"prompt": "Yes.\nTony:", "completion": " I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?"}
{"prompt": "You don't remember?\nTony:", "completion": " I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on."}
{"prompt": "You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... \"The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.\"\nTony:", "completion": " You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?"}
{"prompt": "How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.\nTony:", "completion": " Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse."}
{"prompt": "But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.\nTony:", "completion": " You're something else."}
{"prompt": "You have met him, I assume?\nTony:", "completion": " Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier."}
{"prompt": "I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.\nTony:", "completion": " What's next for you in your world?"}
{"prompt": "The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.\nTony:", "completion": " You are a maniac."}
{"prompt": "You're not going deaf, are you?\nTony:", "completion": " Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?"}
{"prompt": "832 miles.\nTony:", "completion": " Very nice."}
{"prompt": "I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?\nTony:", "completion": " Break it, you bought it."}
{"prompt": "I think I bought it.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first."}
{"prompt": "What are you gonna do to me?\nTony:", "completion": " You'll see."}
{"prompt": "It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.\nTony:", "completion": " Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two..."}
{"prompt": "How did we get this shift?\nTony:", "completion": " All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!"}
{"prompt": "Wow. That was...\nTony:", "completion": " You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone."}
{"prompt": "I am just beyond terrified.\nTony:", "completion": " Here it comes. Three, four..."}
{"prompt": "Shut up.\nTony:", "completion": " Five, four, three, two, one! Told you. Where's the rest? Where's the rest?"}
{"prompt": "Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.\nTony:", "completion": " Ah! Better late than never. Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way."}
{"prompt": "All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.\nTony:", "completion": " Ah! Let's go! Aw, crap."}
{"prompt": "Tony?\nTony:", "completion": " Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit."}
{"prompt": "No. You got yours'?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet."}
{"prompt": "You, you, you! Move! Get out!\nTony:", "completion": " The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin."}
{"prompt": "What's this? I had winners.\nTony:", "completion": " What have you come as?"}
{"prompt": "You make a move, and I break your face.\nTony:", "completion": " I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me."}
{"prompt": "This is the Mandarin?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing."}
{"prompt": "Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.\nTony:", "completion": " Here's how it works, Meryl Streep."}
{"prompt": "Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.\nTony:", "completion": " Spill."}
{"prompt": "Do you know what they did to my suit?\nTony:", "completion": " What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there."}
{"prompt": "Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, a little bit.\nTony:", "completion": " So?"}
{"prompt": "What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.\nTony:", "completion": " Right. Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a \"lovely speedboat\"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is."}
{"prompt": "But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?\nTony:", "completion": " Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president."}
{"prompt": "Thanks. Hello?\nTony:", "completion": " Sir, this is Tony Stark."}
{"prompt": "Welcome back to the land of the living.\nTony:", "completion": " We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.\nTony:", "completion": " And what about the suit I'm wearing?"}
{"prompt": "The armour is now at 92%.\nTony:", "completion": " That's going to have to do."}
{"prompt": "Everything all right, Colonel?\nTony:", "completion": " The President. Now."}
{"prompt": "He's not here. Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish.\nTony:", "completion": " Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. How many in the air?"}
{"prompt": "Thirteen, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " How many can I carry?"}
{"prompt": "Four, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, God! No! No!\nTony:", "completion": " Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?"}
{"prompt": "What? Oh!\nTony:", "completion": " I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do."}
{"prompt": "18,000 feet.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice."}
{"prompt": "10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.\nTony:", "completion": " Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!"}
{"prompt": "1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello."}
{"prompt": "We made it!\nTony:", "completion": " Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... That came out of nowhere. Wow"}
{"prompt": "Give me some good news, man.\nTony:", "completion": " I think they all made it."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank God.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, but I missed the president."}
{"prompt": "You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?"}
{"prompt": "The House Party Protocol, sir?\nTony:", "completion": " Correct."}
{"prompt": "Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?\nTony:", "completion": " I hope not."}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God. He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.\nTony:", "completion": " Viking funeral. Public execution."}
{"prompt": "ls your gun up?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep. What do I do?"}
{"prompt": "Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.\nTony:", "completion": " Six, high, back. Alright. You see that? Nailed it."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, you really killed the glass.\nTony:", "completion": " You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance."}
{"prompt": "I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.\nTony:", "completion": " I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?"}
{"prompt": "They're not universal, Tony.\nTony:", "completion": " I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one."}
{"prompt": "Okay\nTony:", "completion": " Give me one of yours."}
{"prompt": "I don't have one that fits that gun.\nTony:", "completion": " You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?"}
{"prompt": "What'd you see?\nTony:", "completion": " Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. Three guys, one girl, all armed."}
{"prompt": "God, I would kill for some armour right now.\nTony:", "completion": " You're right. We need backup."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, a bunch.\nTony:", "completion": " You know what?"}
{"prompt": "Is that...?\nTony:", "completion": " Yep."}
{"prompt": "Are those...?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice."}
{"prompt": "Yes, sir.\nTony:", "completion": " What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church."}
{"prompt": "Gentlemen.\nTony:", "completion": " Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing."}
{"prompt": "This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?\nTony:", "completion": " Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? Nice timing."}
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?\nTony:", "completion": " Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me."}
{"prompt": "What does that mean?\nTony:", "completion": " I got you covered."}
{"prompt": "Sir, I've located Ms Potts.\nTony:", "completion": " About time."}
{"prompt": "Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.\nTony:", "completion": " See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?"}
{"prompt": "You're such a jerk.\nTony:", "completion": " Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. Come on. A little more, baby."}
{"prompt": "She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, you take a minute. Jarvis, give me a suit right now! Oh, come on!"}
{"prompt": "Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.\nTony:", "completion": " Nice work."}
{"prompt": "What do you mean \"ready\"?\nTony:", "completion": " Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No!"}
{"prompt": "A shame. I would've caught her.\nTony:", "completion": " Eject."}
{"prompt": "Mark 42, inbound.\nTony:", "completion": " I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. Whatever."}
{"prompt": "You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42."}
{"prompt": "No! No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. *I AM THE MANDARIN!!!*\nTony:", "completion": " I got nothing. Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? Honey?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, my God. That was really violent.\nTony:", "completion": " You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were..."}
{"prompt": "I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?\nTony:", "completion": " It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal."}
{"prompt": "You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?\nTony:", "completion": " Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here."}
{"prompt": "No, don't touch me.\nTony:", "completion": " Don't worry about it."}
{"prompt": "No, I'm gonna burn you.\nTony:", "completion": " No, you're not. Not hot."}
{"prompt": "Am I gonna be okay?\nTony:", "completion": " No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff."}
{"prompt": "And all your distractions?\nTony:", "completion": " Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey."}
{"prompt": "All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?\nTony:", "completion": " You know what to do."}
{"prompt": "The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?\nTony:", "completion": " Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. Okay, so far? Do you like it?"}
{"prompt": "So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man. You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.\nTony:", "completion": " To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... Are you with me?"}
{"prompt": "Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...\nTony:", "completion": " Are you actively napping?"}
{"prompt": "I was... I... I drifted.\nTony:", "completion": " Where did I lose you?"}
{"prompt": "Elevator in Switzerland.\nTony:", "completion": " So, you heard none of it?"}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.\nTony:", "completion": " So?"}
{"prompt": "I don't have the...\nTony:", "completion": " What? The time?"}
{"prompt": "Temperament.\nTony:", "completion": " You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?"}
{"prompt": "Who are you talking to?\nPeter:", "completion": " No one. Just making a little video of the trip."}
{"prompt": "Fun.\nPeter:", "completion": " So, uh, why do they call you Happy?"}
{"prompt": "This is your first time on a private plane?\nPeter:", "completion": " My first time on any plane."}
{"prompt": "My first time on any plane.\nPeter:", "completion": " Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?"}
{"prompt": "Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?\nPeter:", "completion": " Shh."}
{"prompt": "Go. Please.\nPeter:", "completion": " My room is way bigger than..."}
{"prompt": "There.\nPeter:", "completion": " I found the case. I found the case. I found the case."}
{"prompt": "Happy, Happy, wait.\nPeter:", "completion": " This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life."}

{"prompt": "Go for Ned.\nPeter:", "completion": " Ned, I need you to track my phone for me."}
{"prompt": "Damn.\nPeter:", "completion": " Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?"}
{"prompt": "Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.\nPeter:", "completion": " What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!"}
{"prompt": "Peter, are you okay?\nPeter:", "completion": " Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, yeah.\nPeter:", "completion": " Oh, god. Okay, ready?"}
{"prompt": "Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.\nPeter:", "completion": " Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nPeter:", "completion": " Hey! Ah! Whew."}
{"prompt": "Get out of there! What are you doing?\nPeter:", "completion": " Please turn! Please turn!"}
{"prompt": "You saved me. It was awesome.\nPeter:", "completion": " Hey, Liz!"}
{"prompt": "Bye.\nPeter:", "completion": " Liz."}
{"prompt": "Yeah.\nPeter:", "completion": " Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?"}
{"prompt": "Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.\nPeter:", "completion": " Is he here too?"}
{"prompt": "Good.\nTony:", "completion": " Give me a minute with the kid."}
{"prompt": "Seriously?\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid."}
{"prompt": "Mr. Stark, I really-\nTony:", "completion": " You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team."}
{"prompt": "You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.\nPeter:", "completion": " To the... To the team?"}
{"prompt": "I...\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah. Give that a look."}
{"prompt": "You turning me down? You better think about this. Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?\nPeter:", "completion": " No."}
{"prompt": "Yeah. Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.\nPeter:", "completion": " Thank you, Mr. Stark."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nTony:", "completion": " Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well."}
{"prompt": "Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.\nPeter:", "completion": " See you around."}
{"prompt": "See you around.\nTony:", "completion": " Okay."}
{"prompt": "Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.\nPeter:", "completion": " Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.\nTony:", "completion": " Yeah, thank you."}
{"prompt": "Did you guys screw this up?\nTony:", "completion": " He told the kid to go wait in the car."}
{"prompt": "Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?\nTony:", "completion": " Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?"}
{"prompt": "Do I... I, uh...\nTony:", "completion": " The engagement ring?"}
{"prompt": "I think I can think of something better than that.\nTony:", "completion": " Well, it would buy us a little time."}
{"prompt": "Well, it would buy us a little time.\nTony:", "completion": " Like we need time."}
{"prompt": "I got it.\nPeter:", "completion": " Aunt May, did you do dinner already?"}
{"prompt": "Aunt May, did you do dinner already?\nPeter:", "completion": " May?"}
{"prompt": "Loki.\nLoki:", "completion": " Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?"}
{"prompt": "Please, don't make this worse.\nLoki:", "completion": " Define worse."}
{"prompt": "Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.\nLoki:", "completion": " I really don't see what all the fuss is about."}
{"prompt": "Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.\nLoki:", "completion": " I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you."}
{"prompt": "We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.\nLoki:", "completion": " Give or take 5000 years."}
{"prompt": "All this because Loki desires a throne.\nLoki:", "completion": " It is my birthright."}
{"prompt": "Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.\nLoki:", "completion": " If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them."}
{"prompt": "Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.\nLoki:", "completion": " And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?"}
{"prompt": "I've got this completely under control!\nThor:", "completion": " Is that why everything is on fire?"}
{"prompt": "You're welcome. All yours.\nThor:", "completion": " Hello. I accept your surrender."}
{"prompt": "Hello. I accept your surrender.\nThor:", "completion": " Anyone else?"}
{"prompt": "Where do we go next?\nThor:", "completion": " Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait."}
{"prompt": "You have my thanks.\nThor:", "completion": " As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready."}
{"prompt": "Is Vanaheim secure?\nThor:", "completion": " As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore."}
{"prompt": "You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.\nThor:", "completion": " That was not my intent."}
{"prompt": "For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.\nThor:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.\nThor:", "completion": " This isn't about Jane Foster, Father."}
{"prompt": "There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.\nThor:", "completion": " I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second."}
{"prompt": "Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.\nThor:", "completion": " No, this is one I set myself."}
{"prompt": "It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.\nThor:", "completion": " I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif."}
{"prompt": "You're late.\nThor:", "completion": " Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle."}
{"prompt": "Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.\nThor:", "completion": " Perhaps. How fare the stars?"}
{"prompt": "You recall what I told you of the Convergence?\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?"}
{"prompt": "The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.\nThor:", "completion": " I see nothing."}
{"prompt": "Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.\nThor:", "completion": " How is she?"}
{"prompt": "She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...\nThor:", "completion": " What?"}
{"prompt": "That's weird. Typical.\nThor:", "completion": " Jane."}
{"prompt": "Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.\nThor:", "completion": " Well, I am. Jane..."}
{"prompt": "Where were you?!\nThor:", "completion": " Where were you? Heimdall could not see you."}
{"prompt": "I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back\nThor:", "completion": " I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter."}
{"prompt": "As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!\nThor:", "completion": " Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this."}
{"prompt": "What?\nThor:", "completion": " I know..."}
{"prompt": "You do?\nThor:", "completion": " Do what?"}
{"prompt": "Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?\nThor:", "completion": " Space is fine."}
{"prompt": "This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me.\nThor:", "completion": " Jane! Jane? You alright?"}
{"prompt": "Place your hands on your head, step back!\nThor:", "completion": " The woman is unwell."}
{"prompt": "She's dangerous.\nThor:", "completion": " So am I."}
{"prompt": "Requesting armed response officers to the scene.\nThor:", "completion": " Hold on to me."}
{"prompt": "Be still.\nThor:", "completion": " This is not of Earth, what is it?"}
{"prompt": "My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?\nThor:", "completion": " She's ill."}
{"prompt": "She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.\nThor:", "completion": " I brought here because we can help her."}
{"prompt": "You told your Dad about me?\nThor:", "completion": " Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before."}
{"prompt": "Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard.\nThor:", "completion": " Don't touch her. Jane, are you alright?"}
{"prompt": "The infection, it's defending her.\nThor:", "completion": " No, it's defending itself."}
{"prompt": "Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.\nThor:", "completion": " \"Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light.\" They were these stories mother told us as children."}
{"prompt": "He killed them all.\nThor:", "completion": " Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is."}
{"prompt": "I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe.\nLoki:", "completion": " Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful."}
{"prompt": "The books I sent, do they not interest you?\nLoki:", "completion": " Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?"}
{"prompt": "I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.\nLoki:", "completion": " Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night."}
{"prompt": "You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\nLoki:", "completion": " My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king."}
{"prompt": "A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\nLoki:", "completion": " A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself."}
{"prompt": "Your father...\nLoki:", "completion": " He's not my father!"}
{"prompt": "Then am I not your mother?\nLoki:", "completion": " You're not."}
{"prompt": "When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.\nThor:", "completion": " Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth."}
{"prompt": "Well, how's that possible?\nThor:", "completion": " I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost."}
{"prompt": "I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?\nThor:", "completion": " I'll find a way to save you, Jane."}
{"prompt": "Your father said there was...\nThor:", "completion": " My father doesn't know everything."}
{"prompt": "Don't let him hear you say that.\nThor:", "completion": " Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother."}
{"prompt": "Hi.\nLoki:", "completion": " You might want to take the stairs to the left."}
{"prompt": "The prisons.\nThor:", "completion": " Loki."}
{"prompt": "There's no pleasing some creatures.\nThor:", "completion": " Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. Very well, you don't have my word."}
{"prompt": "We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless.\nThor:", "completion": " She's your prisoner now? Leave us."}
{"prompt": "I do not wish to fight with you.\nThor:", "completion": " Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith."}
{"prompt": "We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, and you will destroy us."}
{"prompt": "You overestimate the power of these creatures.\nThor:", "completion": " No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him."}
{"prompt": "If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.\nThor:", "completion": " The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it."}
{"prompt": "If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.\nThor:", "completion": " And how of our men shall fall on theirs?"}
{"prompt": "As many as are needed! We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.\nThor:", "completion": " And how are you different from Malekith?"}
{"prompt": "...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm...\nThor:", "completion": " You're not in Odin's war council?"}
{"prompt": "The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that?\nThor:", "completion": " Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help."}
{"prompt": "I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.\nThor:", "completion": " I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief."}
{"prompt": "As are we all.\nThor:", "completion": " Well I see clearly enough."}
{"prompt": "The risks are too great.\nThor:", "completion": " Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way."}
{"prompt": "What do you require of me?\nThor:", "completion": " What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. We must move Jane off world."}
{"prompt": "There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.\nThor:", "completion": " One, actually."}
{"prompt": "No.\nLoki:", "completion": " Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?"}
{"prompt": "Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\nThor:", "completion": " Loki, enough. No more illusions."}
{"prompt": "Loki, enough. No more illusions.\nLoki:", "completion": " Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?"}
{"prompt": "Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?\nThor:", "completion": " I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament."}
{"prompt": "I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\nLoki:", "completion": " Go on."}
{"prompt": "Go on.\nThor:", "completion": " I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell."}
{"prompt": "I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell.\nLoki:", "completion": " You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?"}
{"prompt": "You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\nThor:", "completion": " I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you."}
{"prompt": "I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Hmm. When do we start?"}
{"prompt": "He will betray you.\nThor:", "completion": " He will try."}
{"prompt": "He will try.\nLoki:", "completion": " This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?"}
{"prompt": "This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?\nThor:", "completion": " If you keep speaking I just might."}
{"prompt": "If you keep speaking I just might.\nLoki:", "completion": " Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. Is this better?"}
{"prompt": "Thor It's better company at least.\nLoki:", "completion": " Still, we could be less conspicuous. Hm, brother. You look ravishing."}
{"prompt": "Still, we could be less conspicuous. Hm, brother. You look ravishing.\nThor:", "completion": " It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form."}
{"prompt": "Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.\nThor:", "completion": " I won't be the one who comes for her."}
{"prompt": "You're...\nLoki:", "completion": " I'm Loki. You may have heard of..."}
{"prompt": "That was for New York.\nLoki:", "completion": " I like her."}
{"prompt": "I'll hold them off. Take her.\nThor:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Betray him and I'll kill you.\nLoki:", "completion": " It's good to see you too, Sif."}
{"prompt": "Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.\nThor:", "completion": " That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot."}
{"prompt": "I will give you as much time as I can.\nThor:", "completion": " Thank you, my friend."}
{"prompt": "If you even think about betraying him...\nLoki:", "completion": " You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing."}
{"prompt": "You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\nThor:", "completion": " I said, \"how hard could it be?\""}
{"prompt": "They're on the ship!\nLoki:", "completion": " They're on the ship! Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster."}
{"prompt": "They're on the ship! Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.\nThor:", "completion": " Shut up, Loki."}
{"prompt": "Shut up, Loki.\nLoki:", "completion": " You must have missed something."}
{"prompt": "You must have missed something.\nThor:", "completion": " No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing."}
{"prompt": "No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.\nLoki:", "completion": " No, don't hit it, just press it gently."}
{"prompt": "No, don't hit it, just press it gently.\nThor:", "completion": " I am pressing it gently. It's not working!"}
{"prompt": "Get him! Get him!\nLoki:", "completion": " I think you missed a column."}
{"prompt": "I think you missed a column.\nThor:", "completion": " Shut up!"}
{"prompt": "Shut up!\nLoki:", "completion": " Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot."}
{"prompt": "Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.\nThor:", "completion": " Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly?"}
{"prompt": "Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly?\nLoki:", "completion": " Oh, dear. Is she dead?"}
{"prompt": "Oh, dear. Is she dead?\nThor:", "completion": " Jane."}
{"prompt": "I'm okay.\nThor:", "completion": " Not a word."}
{"prompt": "Not a word.\nLoki:", "completion": " Now they're following us. Now they're firing at us!"}
{"prompt": "Now they're following us. Now they're firing at us!\nThor:", "completion": " Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting!"}
{"prompt": "Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting!\nLoki:", "completion": " Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!"}
{"prompt": "I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki.\nLoki:", "completion": " You lied to me. I'm impressed."}
{"prompt": "You lied to me. I'm impressed.\nThor:", "completion": " I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. Fandral."}
{"prompt": "Right. For Asgard. Nothing personal, boys!\nThor:", "completion": " Loki!"}
{"prompt": "Loki!\nLoki:", "completion": " If it were easy everyone would do it."}
{"prompt": "If it were easy everyone would do it.\nThor:", "completion": " Are you mad?"}
{"prompt": "Are you mad?\nLoki:", "completion": " Possibly. Ta-da!"}
{"prompt": "No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home.\nLoki:", "completion": " What I could do with the power that flows through those veins."}
{"prompt": "What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.\nThor:", "completion": " It would consume you."}
{"prompt": "It would consume you.\nLoki:", "completion": " She's holding up alright, for now."}
{"prompt": "She's holding up alright, for now.\nThor:", "completion": " She's strong in ways you'd never even know."}
{"prompt": "She's strong in ways you'd never even know.\nLoki:", "completion": " Say goodbye."}
{"prompt": "Say goodbye.\nThor:", "completion": " Not this day."}
{"prompt": "Not this day.\nLoki:", "completion": " This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you."}
{"prompt": "This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.\nThor:", "completion": " And will that satisfy you?"}
{"prompt": "And will that satisfy you?\nLoki:", "completion": " Satisfaction is not in my nature."}
{"prompt": "Satisfaction is not in my nature.\nThor:", "completion": " Surrender not in mine."}
{"prompt": "Surrender not in mine.\nLoki:", "completion": " The son of Odin."}
{"prompt": "The son of Odin.\nThor:", "completion": " No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!"}
{"prompt": "No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\nLoki:", "completion": " Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!"}
{"prompt": "Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!\nThor:", "completion": " What help were you in your cell?"}
{"prompt": "What help were you in your cell?\nLoki:", "completion": " Who put me there? Who put me there?!"}
{"prompt": "Who put me there? Who put me there?!\nThor:", "completion": " You know damn well! You know damn well who! She wouldn't want us to fight."}
{"prompt": "You know damn well! You know damn well who! She wouldn't want us to fight.\nLoki:", "completion": " Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked."}
{"prompt": "Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.\nThor:", "completion": " I wish I could trust you."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could trust you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Trust my rage."}
{"prompt": "There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. Take me to Jane's lab!\nThor:", "completion": " Jane."}
{"prompt": "Malekith.\nThor:", "completion": " Alright, are you ready?"}
{"prompt": "Alright, are you ready?\nLoki:", "completion": " I am. You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed."}
{"prompt": "I am. You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.\nThor:", "completion": " Yeah, possibly."}
{"prompt": "Yeah, possibly.\nLoki:", "completion": " You still don't trust me, brother?"}
{"prompt": "You still don't trust me, brother?\nThor:", "completion": " Would you?"}
{"prompt": "Would you?\nLoki:", "completion": " No, I wouldn't."}
{"prompt": "Thor! No!\nLoki:", "completion": " You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn."}
{"prompt": "Look at me.\nThor:", "completion": " Loki, now! No!"}
{"prompt": "Loki, now! No!\nLoki:", "completion": " See you in hell, monster!"}
{"prompt": "See you in hell, monster!\nThor:", "completion": " No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!"}
{"prompt": "No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!\nLoki:", "completion": " I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool!"}
{"prompt": "I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool!\nThor:", "completion": " Stay with me, okay?"}
{"prompt": "Stay with me, okay?\nLoki:", "completion": " I'm sorry. I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nThor:", "completion": " Shh."}
{"prompt": "Shh.\nLoki:", "completion": " I'm sorry."}
{"prompt": "I'm sorry.\nThor:", "completion": " It's okay. It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today."}
{"prompt": "It's okay. It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.\nLoki:", "completion": " I didn't do it for him."}
{"prompt": "I didn't do it for him.\nThor:", "completion": " No!"}
{"prompt": "He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.\nThor:", "completion": " How? Jane, how?"}
{"prompt": "I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?\nThor:", "completion": " The Convergence."}
{"prompt": "Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.\nThor:", "completion": " Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner."}
{"prompt": "I only found it because I was looking for you.\nThor:", "completion": " Jane."}
{"prompt": "Now we're trapped here.\nThor:", "completion": " It's not me."}
{"prompt": "I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel?\nThor:", "completion": " Where are we going?"}
{"prompt": "Hello?\nThor:", "completion": " Why are there so many shoes in here?"}
{"prompt": "Okay.\nThor:", "completion": " Are you well, Erik?"}
{"prompt": "Your brother is not coming, is he?\nThor:", "completion": " Loki is dead."}
{"prompt": "Oh, thank God. I...I'm so sorry.\nThor:", "completion": " Thank you."}
{"prompt": "Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.\nThor:", "completion": " Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time."}

{"prompt": "You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.\nThor:", "completion": " But you can."}
{"prompt": "You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?\nThor:", "completion": " My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King."}
{"prompt": "Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?\nThor:", "completion": " When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing."}

{"prompt": "I've got this completely under control!\nThor:", "completion": " Is that why everything's on fire?"}
{"prompt": "All yours.\nThor:", "completion": " Hello. I accept your surrender."}
{"prompt": "Hello. I accept your surrender.\nThor:", "completion": " Anyone else?"}
{"prompt": "Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!\nLoki:", "completion": " I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you."}
{"prompt": "We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.\nLoki:", "completion": " Give or take five thousand years."}
{"prompt": "All this because Loki desires a throne...\nLoki:", "completion": " It is my birthright!"}
{"prompt": "Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.\nLoki:", "completion": " If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them."}

{"prompt": "Where were you?!\nThor:", "completion": " Where were you? Heimdall could not see you."}

{"prompt": "Then am I not your mother?\nLoki:", "completion": " You're not."}
{"prompt": "I believe you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?"}
{"prompt": "Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\nThor:", "completion": " Loki, enough. No more illusions."}
{"prompt": "Loki, enough. No more illusions.\nLoki:", "completion": " Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?"}
{"prompt": "Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?\nThor:", "completion": " I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament."}
{"prompt": "I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\nLoki:", "completion": " Go on."}
{"prompt": "Go on.\nThor:", "completion": " I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell."}
{"prompt": "I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.\nLoki:", "completion": " You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?"}
{"prompt": "You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\nThor:", "completion": " I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you."}
{"prompt": "I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Hm. When do we start?"}
{"prompt": "That was for New York!\nLoki:", "completion": " I like her."}
{"prompt": "Betray him, and I'll kill you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Good to see you too, Sif."}
{"prompt": "You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.\nLoki:", "completion": " You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant-"}
{"prompt": "I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!\nLoki:", "completion": " You lied to me. I'm impressed."}
{"prompt": "You lied to me. I'm impressed.\nLoki:", "completion": " If it were easy, everyone would do it."}
{"prompt": "If it were easy, everyone would do it.\nThor:", "completion": " Are you mad?"}
{"prompt": "Are you mad?\nLoki:", "completion": " Possibly."}
{"prompt": "Possibly.\nThor:", "completion": " You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!"}
{"prompt": "You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\nLoki:", "completion": " Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!"}
{"prompt": "Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!\nThor:", "completion": " What good were you in your cell?"}
{"prompt": "What good were you in your cell?\nLoki:", "completion": " Who put me there? Who put me there?!"}

{"prompt": "Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.\nThor:", "completion": " I wish I could trust you."}
{"prompt": "I wish I could trust you.\nLoki:", "completion": " Trust my rage."}
{"prompt": "Trust my rage.\nThor:", "completion": " I will tell Father what you did here today."}
{"prompt": "I will tell Father what you did here today.\nLoki:", "completion": " I didn't do it for him."}
{"prompt": "You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.\nThor:", "completion": " Not by your hand!"}

Gone and left you nothing. And for what? Pathetic! He deserved to burn! Look at her and tell me I'm wrong. She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way. Destroy her, Diana. You know that she deserves. That they all do. Do it!\nSteve:", "completion": " Diana! Diana..."}
